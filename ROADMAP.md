    `femic-k3z-instance` docs, then reconcile FEMIC docs where needed so FRESH
    lab docs present a consistent user experience.
  - [x] P12.5d Add a template-compliance checklist in CI/docs-contract tests to
    prevent drift across FRESH lab documentation projects.
  - [x] P12.5e Ensure FHOPS template alignment preserves BC data-package depth
    expectations for K3Z documentation content.
- [x] P12.6 Finalize and operationalize docs ownership

## Detailed Next Steps Notes
- 2026-03-11 (repo-root cleanup: legacy notebook archive move):
  moved legacy notebook artifacts out of repository root into a dedicated
  archive location.
  - Moved notebook files:
    `00_data-prep.ipynb`, `01a_run-tsa.ipynb`, `01b_run-tsa.ipynb` ->
    `reference/legacy_notebooks/`.
  - Updated docs/test references to the new notebook location:
    `docs/guides/legacy-traceability.rst`,
    `docs/guides/index.rst`,
    `tests/test_docs_contract.py`.
  - Verified contract/tests/docs build remain green after relocation.
- 2026-03-11 (K3Z species-account bugfix: TIPSY `FD` alias to canonical `FDC`):
  fixed treated species-proportion mapping so species-wise accounts no longer
  drop `FDC` to zero when TIPSY outputs `FD`.
  - Updated bundle assembly in `src/femic/pipeline/bundle.py` to normalize
    TIPSY species aliases (`FD -> FDC`) before writing treated species-prop
    curves.
  - Added regression test
    `tests/test_bundle.py::test_build_bundle_tables_from_curves_maps_tipsy_fd_to_fdc`.
  - Re-ran K3Z post-TIPSY bundle + Patchworks export and verified
    `managed_prop_FDC_985521000004` now exports with `y=0.1`, and
    `au_985501000_managed_yield_FDC` is no longer a flat zero curve.
- 2026-03-10 (P8.7 docs QA + acceptance checks): added automated docs
  contract coverage for Sample Models navigation and required K3Z sections,
  and added a release-readiness checklist for student distribution.
  - Extended `tests/test_docs_contract.py` with:
    - Sample Models toctree/page existence checks (`k3z`, `k3z-metadata-lineage`),
    - required heading checks for `docs/sample-models/k3z.rst`,
    - required heading checks for
      `docs/sample-models/k3z-metadata-lineage.rst`.
  - Added `Release Readiness Checklist` section to
    `docs/sample-models/k3z.rst`.
  - Marked `P8.7a/P8.7b/P8.7c` complete.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 8 `P8.6d` complete: regenerated strata/AU plot rollout):
  integrated regenerated K3Z strata/AU QA plot artifacts into user-facing
  Sample Models documentation.
  - Added new section `Regenerated Strata/AU Build Plots` to
    `docs/sample-models/k3z.rst` with explicit artifact families:
    `plots/strata-tsak3z.png`, `plots/vdyp_lmh_tsak3z-*.png`,
    `plots/tipsy_vdyp_tsak3z-*.png`.
  - Updated K3Z release checklist to require regenerated plot presence prior to
    student distribution.
  - Extended `tests/test_docs_contract.py` K3Z section contract to require the
    new plot section and artifact-pattern references.
  - Marked `P8.6d` complete; with `P8.6a/P8.6b/P8.6c` already complete, parent
    `P8.6` is now complete.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 8 status normalization): parent `P8.3` marked complete
  because all child items (`P8.3a/P8.3b/P8.3c`) were already completed.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 status normalization): parent `P10.1`, `P10.2`, and
  `P10.3` marked complete because all child items were already completed.
- 2026-03-10 (P8.5 scenario interpretation guidance): completed trajectory
  interpretation guidance for classroom scenario analysis in K3Z docs.
  - Added `Scenario Comparison Guidance` to `docs/sample-models/k3z.rst`
    covering within-scenario and cross-scenario comparison workflow.
  - Added explicit treatment-shift interpretation guidance using
    `product.Seral.area.<stage>.<au_id>.CC` trajectories.
  - Added a minimum report-template matrix mapping analytical questions to
    account sources and aggregation patterns for student exercises.
  - Marked `P8.5a/P8.5b/P8.5c` complete.
- 2026-03-10 (P8.2c + P8.4c completion): expanded K3Z guide with explicit
  student-facing parameter risk ranges and backup/recovery conventions.
  - Added `Parameter Risk and Suggested Ranges` section to
    `docs/sample-models/k3z.rst` covering IFM share/threshold tuning,
    topology radius, seral boundaries, CC min-age behavior, and horizon risk.
  - Added `Backup and Recovery Conventions` section to document run-log
    retention, automatic `accounts.csv` timestamp backups, and regeneration-
    first recovery practices.
  - Marked `P8.2c` and `P8.4c` complete; with this, `P8.2` and `P8.4` are
    now fully complete.
- 2026-03-10 (P8.1 metadata + lineage baseline): completed initial K3Z
  metadata lineage capture for student-facing use and future rebuild governance.
  - Added docs page `docs/sample-models/k3z-metadata-lineage.rst` with:
    source inventory for `data/`, `yield/`, `blocks/`, explicit lineage chain,
    and a provenance versioning policy/checklist.
  - Added machine-readable registry
    `models/k3z_patchworks_model/metadata/lineage_registry.yaml` encoding
    artifact-to-source mappings, builder commands, and provenance rules.
  - Wired metadata page into Sample Models docs navigation
    (`docs/sample-models/index.rst`) and linked from K3Z guide.
  - Marked `P8.1a/P8.1b/P8.1c` complete.
- 2026-03-10 (P6.4 onboarding regression scenarios): completed the queued
  onboarding regression test slice by adding template-driven case preflight and
  docs-linkage contract coverage.
  - Added `tests/test_case_preflight_cli.py` scenarios for:
    - smoke instantiation from `config/run_profile.case_template.yaml` +
      `config/tipsy/template.case.yaml` (new TSA code) passing
      `femic prep validate-case`;
    - boundary-mode compatibility using template-derived profile
      (`selection.boundary_path`/`selection.boundary_code`) with matching
      `tsa<boundary_code>.yaml` config.
  - Added docs contract check in `tests/test_docs_contract.py` requiring
    `docs/guides/case-onboarding.rst` to keep links to both onboarding
    templates plus the `femic prep validate-case` command.
  - Marked `P6.4a/P6.4b/P6.4c` complete.
- 2026-03-10 (Sample Models docs + K3Z deep-dive launch): added a new
  top-level Sphinx "Sample Models" section and published a detailed K3Z guide at
  `docs/sample-models/k3z.rst`, anchored to the in-repo authoritative model
  state at `models/k3z_patchworks_model/`.
  - Documented purpose/scope, provenance, full component mapping, rebuild
    commands, runtime pathing, and matrix-builder artifact expectations.
  - Explicitly documented post-build accounts promotion behavior:
    `tracks/protoaccounts.csv -> tracks/accounts.csv` with timestamped backup.
  - Added user guidance for assumptions/parameters, edit policy, seral account
    semantics, and common troubleshooting signatures.
  - Added new planning phase `Phase 8` to drive full student-facing K3Z
    metadata/how-to documentation to completion.
  - Marked completed Phase 8 starter tasks in checklist form (`P8.2a/P8.2b`,
    `P8.3a/P8.3b/P8.3c`, `P8.4a/P8.4b`, `P8.6a/P8.6b/P8.6c`) so roadmap
    progress reflects delivered docs work.
- 2026-03-09 (THLB/IFM tuning for Patchworks export): confirmed legacy 00 THLB
  assignment logic is still in effect (`assign_thlb_area_and_flag` with fixed
  thresholds 93/69/50 and `thlb_raw` expected on percent-like scale), and added
  explicit export-time IFM tuning controls to avoid guesswork when checkpoints
  carry continuous THLB values (for example `[0,1]`).
  - New `femic export patchworks` options:
    - `--ifm-source-col` (explicit THLB signal column, e.g. `thlb_raw`)
    - `--ifm-threshold` (managed when signal > threshold)
    - `--ifm-target-managed-share` (top-N stands managed by signal rank)
  - `--ifm-threshold` and `--ifm-target-managed-share` are mutually exclusive.
  - This keeps legacy defaults unchanged unless an operator opts into tuning.
- 2026-03-09 (1:1 blocks + topology pipeline step): added
  `femic patchworks build-blocks` to compile a sample-aligned blocks package
  from `data/fragments.shp` with strict stand:block identity (`BLOCK` copied
  from `FEATURE_ID`/`FRAGS_ID`) and optional topology generation.
  - Output contract:
    - `<model>/blocks/blocks.shp`
    - `<model>/blocks/topology_blocks_<radius>r.csv` (default radius `200`)
  - Topology CSV schema matches Patchworks sample usage:
    `BLOCK1,BLOCK2,DISTANCE,LENGTH`, including exterior `-9999` rows for PIN
    `control.inputTopology(...)` wiring.
  - Live validation completed on
    `C:\Users\gep\Documents\msfm\msfm2025\k3z_patchworks_model` with
    `blocks=218` and `edges=928` at `200m` radius.
- 2026-03-09 (Windows runtime config path correction): updated
  `config/patchworks.runtime.windows.yaml` paths from stale Desktop location to
  active model root under
  `C:\Users\gep\Documents\msfm\msfm2025\k3z_patchworks_model`.
- 2026-03-09 (K3Z script adaptation): replaced
  `C:\Users\gep\Desktop\msfm2025\k3z_patchworks_model\scripts\dataPrep\prepareBlocks.bsh`
  with a FEMIC-aligned variant that:
  - targets `data/fragments.*`, `yield/forestmodel.xml`, and `tracks/`,
  - requires `yield/forestmodel.xml` explicitly (no C5 fallback filename),
  - runs Matrix Builder through `new ca.spatial.tracks.builder.Process(...).execute(false)`,
    then waits on the process object for completion,
  - keeps C5-style dissolve/join steps as optional toggles and skips safely when
    lookup inputs are missing.
- 2026-03-09 (K3Z Patchworks model layout reorg): created
  `C:\Users\gep\Desktop\msfm2025\k3z_patchworks_model` with top-level folders
  mirroring Patchworks `sample_2024` structure (`analysis`, `blocks`, `data`,
  `imagery`, `misc`, `roads`, `scenarios`, `scripts`, `tracks`, `yield`).
- Copied K3Z runtime artifacts into sample-aligned locations:
  - fragments shapefile set -> `...\k3z_patchworks_model\data\fragments.*`
  - ForestModel XML -> `...\k3z_patchworks_model\yield\forestmodel.xml`
  - seeded scripts from `reference/Patchworks-202502/sample_2024/scripts/`.
- Updated `config/patchworks.runtime.windows.yaml` matrix builder paths to use
  the new K3Z model root and verified a successful matrix build run
  (`run_id=win_native_k3z_reorg_20260309`, `returncode=0`) writing tracks to
  `...\k3z_patchworks_model\tracks`.
- 2026-03-09 (Windows-first Patchworks runtime): updated
  `femic patchworks` to support native Windows launch (`java -jar ...`) in
  addition to Linux/Wine, instead of hard-requiring Wine on all hosts.
- 2026-03-09 (matrix-build completion semantics): aligned with Patchworks
  `Process.main(argv)` behavior by treating non-interactive run success as
  artifact-driven (tracks output present + no fatal signatures), recording both
  raw JVM return code and effective FEMIC return code in run manifests.
- 2026-03-09 (matrix output precondition): matrix output directory is now
  created automatically before non-interactive launch to satisfy Patchworks
  constructor requirements (`outName` must exist).
- Completed `P6.3`: added `femic export release` for versioned student-facing
  bundle packaging with strict required-artifact checks, release manifest
  (`release_manifest.json`), and operator handoff notes (`HANDOFF.md`).
- Added release packaging tests and CLI/docs wiring; next queued work starts at
  `P6.4` (onboarding regression scenario tests + docs linkage checks).
- Started Phase 7 runtime integration for proprietary Patchworks tooling:
  added `femic patchworks preflight` and `femic patchworks matrix-build` command
  skeletons with config-driven Wine invocation, Matrix Builder command assembly,
  run log capture, and execution manifest output.
- Added a baseline Patchworks runtime config (`config/patchworks.runtime.yaml`)
  for local editing, and gitignored `reference/Patchworks/` to avoid publishing
  proprietary binaries/API docs.
- Added Phase 7 docs/test wiring for Patchworks runtime and VPN diagnostics;
  verified `reference/Patchworks/` is now ignored and not tracked in git index;
  remaining queued Phase 7 work is first live VPN+Wine validation against the
  real license server environment.
- Updated Patchworks runtime licensing behavior to match real Patchworks
  ownership: `femic patchworks preflight` now validates env/config only
  (`SPS_LICENSE_SERVER`, `SPSHOME`, Wine/Java/jar/input paths) and no longer
  performs direct DNS/TCP checks against inferred license ports/hosts.
- Added required `patchworks.spshome` runtime config support and propagated
  `SPSHOME` injection into Wine subprocess env for `matrix-build` runs.
- Live validation (2026-03-09): `patchworks preflight` now passes in-container
  with `SPSHOME` set to the Wine-visible local Patchworks path, but
  `patchworks matrix-build` still fails internally despite shell return code 0.
  Current blockers from stderr are:
  `no mrsidget2_64 in java.library.path`, GUI/X11 peer creation failures
  (`$DISPLAY` missing), and final license message
  `Not licensed or no connection to license server`; no `tracks/` output
  directory is produced.
- Next queued Phase 7 work: harden matrix-build success detection beyond process
  return code (stderr signature + required output artifact checks), then resolve
  runtime prerequisites (headless/GUI mode compatibility and Patchworks native
  library path) before re-testing VPN/license pass-through.
- Completed matrix-build hardening pass:
  - `patchworks.use_xvfb` config support (wraps launch with `xvfb-run -a`);
  - Windows-side `SPSHOME`/`PATH` injection plus `-Djava.library.path` in
    java launch command;
  - deterministic failure promotion when fatal runtime signatures are found in
    process output or when matrix output directory is missing/empty.
- Live rerun now fails deterministically with explicit blockers:
  `Not licensed or no connection to license server`,
  `IP Helper Library GetAdaptersAddresses function failed`, and missing
  matrix output artifacts.
- Matrix Builder validation from user Windows workstation identified a
  ForestModel schema-order issue (`<input>` unexpectedly encountered near top of
  document). Exporter now emits ForestModel child elements in schema-compatible
  order aligned with current Patchworks samples:
  curves -> define -> input/output -> select.
- Regenerated Patchworks fixtures and re-exported
  `output/patchworks_k3z_validated/forestmodel.xml` with corrected ordering for
  external Matrix Builder retest.
- Follow-up Windows Matrix Builder parse error identified select expression type
  mismatch (`AU` integer column compared to string literal). Exporter now emits
  numeric AU predicates (`AU eq 985501000`) while keeping quoted string
  predicates for `IFM`/`treatment`.
- Re-exported K3Z ForestModel XML with numeric AU expressions for immediate
  external retest.
- Additional Windows Matrix Builder validation shows schema engine mismatch with
  legacy DTD header expectations. Exporter now emits Patchworks XSD model hint
  header (`<?xml-model href="https://www.spatial.ca/ForestModel.xsd"?>`) in
  place of the old DOCTYPE line to align with 2024/2025 sample model format.
- Live preflight now resolves local file paths and Java-in-Wine checks in this
  container; remaining blockers are matrix runtime dependencies and effective
  Patchworks licensing at launch time.
- Phase 6 kickoff complete: added reusable onboarding assets for new cases:
  `config/run_profile.case_template.yaml`, `config/tipsy/template.case.yaml`,
  and `docs/guides/case-onboarding.rst`.
- Guides navigation now includes a dedicated onboarding page so new-case setup
  is discoverable in published docs.
- Next queued work starts at `P6.2` (single-command case preflight validation).
- Completed `P6.2`: added `femic prep validate-case` to run profile-aware
  prerequisite checks (boundary/path integrity, TIPSY config presence/validity,
  external dataset presence, log-dir warnings) with remediation messages and
  optional `--strict-warnings` failure mode.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_case_preflight_cli.py` for preflight
  success and key failure paths (missing TIPSY config, missing boundary code,
  strict warnings), and extended docs drift checks for the new CLI options.
- Next queued work starts at `P6.3` (student-facing release packaging workflow).
- Phase 5 docs recovery milestone completed locally: added a new Guides section
  (`docs/guides/*`), a notebook-to-guides coverage matrix
  (`docs/guides/legacy_notebook_coverage.csv`), and a legacy traceability page
  (`docs/guides/legacy-traceability.rst`) so notebook narrative knowledge is now
  explicitly preserved in published docs.
- Added docs contract tests in `tests/test_docs_contract.py` to enforce guide
  page presence, toctree wiring, notebook markdown coverage completeness, and
  high-value CLI docs drift checks.
- Completed GitHub Pages deployment validation (`P5.7`) after push to `main`:
  verified Guides nav renders and direct guide URLs return HTTP 200.
- Updated docs workflow deploy guard in `.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml` to
  allow deployment for both push and manual `workflow_dispatch` runs on `main`
  (still excludes pull requests).
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m femic --help` now works in the venv.
- `pyproject.toml` defines the `femic` console script; install with `pip install -e .` when ready.
- Added a legacy workflow wrapper that runs `00_data-prep.py` and honors `--tsa`/`--resume`.
- `femic run` now performs preflight checks (use `--skip-checks` to bypass).
- Legacy bundle handling now targets `data/model_input_bundle` only (no legacy auto-copy).
- Removed legacy `data/spadescbm_bundle` directory.
- Normalized `tsa_code`/`tsa` to zero-padded strings to prevent resume-time index mismatches.
- Added a guard that fails fast with a summary when AU assignment yields zero rows.
- Rebuilds `scsi_au` from `au_table` when resuming so curve assignment can proceed.
- Added a `--debug-rows` CLI option to downsample VRI rows for faster iteration.
- Debug row limiting now re-applies after checkpoint reloads to avoid full-size fallbacks.
- Fixed debug row helper ordering so checkpoint loads can call it safely.
- Skips strata lacking VDYP curves to avoid debug-run crashes.
- Debug runs now disable cached checkpoint and output reuse.
- External dataset paths now resolve relative to repo root (`../data`).
- Added external data root override via `FEMIC_EXTERNAL_DATA_ROOT`.
- Fixed raster masking calls to wrap geometries in lists (rasterio expects iterables).
- AU/curve assignment now tolerates missing stratum+SI mappings and logs a warning summary before
  dropping unmapped rows.
- Added `planning/VDYP_debug_notes.md` and queued a VDYP diagnostics + metadata
  hardening focus.
- Added VDYP run and curve-fit diagnostics logs plus toe-fit auto-trimming with warnings to keep
  the pipeline moving while recording failures.
- Updated curve anchoring to quasi-origin `(1, 1e-6)` so zero-value filtering can stay strict.
- Added pre-VDYP TSA checkpointing (`data/vdyp_prep-tsa{tsa}.pkl`) for faster warm-starts.
- Pre-VDYP checkpoint payloads now strip non-picklable fit callables for reliable resume loads.
- Added minimal validation scaffolding: `tests/`, `docs/`, and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Verified TSA 08 rerun writes `vdyp_io/logs/vdyp_curve_events.jsonl` entries with
  `first_age=1.0` and `first_volume=1e-06`.
- Added `femic vdyp report` to summarize `vdyp_runs.jsonl` + `vdyp_curve_events.jsonl`
  (status/stage/phase counts, parse errors, first-point conformance, mismatch samples).
- Added fallback handling for `nsamples="auto"` with small strata so VDYP runs all available
  records instead of raising `AssertionError`.
- Added explicit warnings + JSONL metadata when curve build/tipsy-input stages encounter
  missing VDYP outputs for specific stratum+SI combinations.
- Forced a fresh TSA 08 debug rerun (`--debug-rows 500`) and confirmed non-empty logs:
  `vdyp_runs.jsonl` (77 events) and `vdyp_curve_events.jsonl` (26 events).
- Hardened sparse-curve handling in `process_vdyp_out`: if smoothed body-fit inputs are empty or
  too short, emit a warning event and return a quasi-origin-anchored fallback curve instead of
  crashing on `idxmax()`.
- Moved `scsi_au`/`au_scsi` registration to only occur for stratum+SI combos that pass all
  operability/species filters and have usable VDYP output.
- Hardened AU-table build in `00_data-prep.py` to skip VDYP curve combos that have no AU mapping,
  with a top-10 warning summary instead of raising `KeyError`.
- Re-ran forced TSA 08 debug (`--debug-rows 500`) from fresh VDYP and reached end-to-end completion
  (process exit code `0`) with populated logs:
  `vdyp_runs.jsonl` (77 events) and `vdyp_curve_events.jsonl` (27 events, including 1
  `body_input` sparse-data warning fallback).
- Defaulted row-wise apply paths back to pandas `.apply(...)` (with optional
  `FEMIC_USE_SWIFTER=1` opt-in) to reduce swifter-related instability/noise during debug runs.
- Added `FEMIC_DISABLE_IPP` handling (default `1`) so debug runs use serial execution without
  ipyparallel controller dependencies.
- Added `FEMIC_SKIP_STANDS_SHP` handling (defaults to skip in debug mode) to bypass final
  shapefile export when iterating rapidly.
- The non-fatal shutdown message (`Error in sys.excepthook` / `Original exception was`) still
  appears even on exit code `0`; root cause remains unresolved, but pipeline outputs and VDYP
  diagnostics are now completing reliably in forced TSA08 debug reruns.
- Updated citation metadata repository URL to match the active remote:
  `https://github.com/UBC-FRESH/wbi_ria_yield`.
- Fixed singleton-stratum handling in `fit_stratum` by forcing `f_.loc[[sc]]` DataFrame access
  (avoids accidental Series coercion and `KeyError: np.False_` during boolean filtering).
- Added guards for empty species mixes in TIPSY-input assembly: if a stratum+SI has no species
  candidates after filtering, emit `no_species_candidates` warning metadata and skip that combo
  instead of raising `IndexError`.
- Stopped importing `swifter` unless `FEMIC_USE_SWIFTER=1` is explicitly enabled, removing
  default monkeypatch side effects during normal debug runs.
- Reworked `run_data_prep` to execute `00_data-prep.py` in a subprocess and stream filtered
  output; this removes persistent non-fatal legacy shutdown noise
  (`Error in sys.excepthook` / `Original exception was`) from `femic run` logs.
- Roadmap review checkpoint (2026-03-01): completed the runtime hardening/diagnostics tranche that
  started this refactor; roadmap focus is now Phase 2 extraction and global-state reduction.
- `femic run` now accepts `--run-id` and `--log-dir`; these are passed to the legacy runner and
  exported as `FEMIC_RUN_ID` / `FEMIC_LOG_DIR`.
- Added per-run manifest output (`run_manifest-<run_id>.json`) with command/options, env flags,
  TSA list, checkpoint presence, and resolved run-scoped log paths.
- VDYP logs are now emitted per TSA + run id
  (`vdyp_runs-tsa{tsa}-{run_id}.jsonl`, `vdyp_curve_events-tsa{tsa}-{run_id}.jsonl`).
- Added deterministic TSA08 regression fixtures under `tests/fixtures/vdyp/tsa08_debug/` and
  tests that assert stable `summarize_vdyp_logs` counts.
- Added warning-budget evaluation (`evaluate_warning_budget`) and CLI threshold flags on
  `femic vdyp report` so CI can fail when warnings/parse-errors grow beyond expected bounds.
- Added per-TSA raw VDYP stream artifacts:
  `vdyp_stdout-tsa{tsa}-{run_id}.log` and `vdyp_stderr-tsa{tsa}-{run_id}.log`.
- Expanded run manifest payloads with runtime/package versions, resolved key paths, and per-TSA
  artifact existence inventory for `vdyp_runs`, `vdyp_curve_events`, `vdyp_stdout`, and
  `vdyp_stderr`.
- Phase 1 checklist reconciled with completed runtime hardening deliverables; remaining work now starts at
  Phase 2 modularization tasks (P2.1+).
- Started Phase 2 module extraction with new reusable helpers under `src/femic/pipeline/`:
  `io.py`, `vdyp.py`, `tsa.py`, and `plots.py`.
- Legacy workflow manifest/log path logic now consumes `femic.pipeline` helpers, reducing
  duplicated logic and defining a stable seam for future migration out of notebook-generated code.
- Removed hardcoded multi-TSA defaults from new pipeline helpers; default TSA selection now reads
  from dev config (`config/dev.toml`, `[run].default_tsa_list`) with `["08"]` fallback for local
  testing.
- Introduced explicit `PipelineRunConfig` handoff from CLI to workflow wrapper so run settings
  (`tsa_list`, `resume`, `debug_rows`, `run_id`, `log_dir`) are passed as typed config instead of
  loose parameters; this is the first concrete step toward `P2.1b` global-state reduction.
- Added `LegacyExecutionPlan` builder in pipeline I/O helpers; legacy runner now consumes a fully
  resolved execution plan (command, env, run IDs, paths, checkpoints) instead of constructing this
  state inline.
- `P2.1b` is now partially complete at the CLI/workflow boundary (typed run config + execution
  plan); remaining `P2.1b` work is to eliminate notebook-script globals inside `00_data-prep.py`
  and `01a_run-tsa.py`.
- Extracted subprocess execution into `femic.pipeline.stages.run_legacy_subprocess(...)`, giving a
  reusable stage executor and reducing orchestration logic inside the legacy workflow wrapper.
- Extracted run-manifest assembly into `femic.pipeline.manifest` (`build_run_manifest_payload`,
  `collect_runtime_versions`, `write_manifest`) so workflow wrapper orchestration now calls reusable
  stage + manifest builders instead of maintaining these internals inline.
- Extracted pre-VDYP checkpoint serialization/load/save into `femic.pipeline.pre_vdyp` and wired
  `01a_run-tsa.py` to use these helpers (`load_vdyp_prep_checkpoint`,
  `save_vdyp_prep_checkpoint`), creating the first notebook-derived data-stage seam for `P2.2a`.
- Removed the old `Next Focus` section after merging non-redundant items into phase checklists to
  keep a single source of planning truth.
- Extracted VDYP input/output table I/O helpers into `femic.pipeline.vdyp_io` and refactored
  `01a_run-tsa.py` to call these shared functions (`write_vdyp_infiles_plylyr`,
  `import_vdyp_tables`), extending `P2.2a` modularization with explicit helper seams.
- Extracted VDYP sample-size estimator into `femic.pipeline.vdyp_sampling.nsamples_from_curves`
  and refactored the auto-sampling loop in `01a_run-tsa.py` to consume this helper.
- Extracted run-id/log-path resolution and append helpers into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_logging` (`resolve_run_id`, `build_tsa_vdyp_log_paths`,
  `append_jsonl`, `append_text`) and refactored `01a_run-tsa.py` to consume them.
- Rewired manifest-facing VDYP artifact path builder (`femic.pipeline.vdyp.build_vdyp_log_paths`)
  to reuse `build_tsa_vdyp_log_paths`, removing duplicated filename logic between modules.
- Extracted VDYP curve-building helpers into `femic.pipeline.vdyp_curves` and refactored
  `01a_run-tsa.py` to call shared `process_vdyp_out(...)` logic (including toe-fit retry/fallback
  and quasi-origin anchor behavior) through a reusable module seam.
- Extracted shared VDYP-to-TIPSY scalar derivations into `femic.pipeline.tipsy`
  (`compute_vdyp_site_index`, `compute_vdyp_oaf1`) and refactored all TSA-specific TIPSY parameter
  builders in `01a_run-tsa.py` to consume these helpers instead of duplicating inline parsing logic.
- Added reusable TIPSY candidate evaluation + warning payload helpers in `femic.pipeline.tipsy`
  (`evaluate_tipsy_candidate`, `build_tipsy_warning_event`) and rewired the AU-selection loop in
  `01a_run-tsa.py` to use centralized eligibility reasoning + standardized warning metadata.
- Added initial manual-handoff TIPSY config scaffolding under `config/tipsy/` with a draft template
  (`template.tsa.yaml`) and notes capturing cross-TSA variability from the five legacy TSA rule
  dicts (08/16/24/40/41), to guide migration from hard-coded logic to expert-authored config.
- Added `femic.pipeline.tipsy_config` with TSA YAML loader/validator and config-rule evaluation
  (`load_tipsy_tsa_config`, `validate_tipsy_tsa_config`, `build_tipsy_params_from_config`), and
  wired `01a_run-tsa.py` to prefer `config/tipsy/tsa{tsa}.yaml` (or `.yml`) when present, with
  legacy dict-based dispatch as fallback.
- Added first concrete migrated TSA config `config/tipsy/tsa08.yaml` plus tokenized assignment
  support (e.g., `$leading_species_tipsy`) so config rules can preserve legacy species normalization
  behavior (notably `SX -> SW`) while keeping per-TSA rule logic out of Python code.
- Added second migrated TSA config `config/tipsy/tsa16.yaml` (high-variability case with full
  species-mix/GW field coverage), plus tests that load the repo config and verify expected
  config-driven rule selection output.
- Added third migrated TSA config `config/tipsy/tsa24.yaml` capturing BEC-dependent branching
  (`SBS` vs `ESSF`) and species-group-specific assignment blocks; expanded config tests to verify
  both SBS and ESSF rule-path selection from repo-backed YAML.
- Added `config/tipsy/tsa40.yaml` and `config/tipsy/tsa41.yaml`, completing migration of all five
  legacy TSA rule dict examples into YAML. Extended token support for ranked species placeholders
  (`$species_rank_<n>_tipsy`, `$species_pct_<n>`) and added tests covering dynamic species token
  expansion and forest-type-conditioned rule selection.
- Switched legacy runner default to require config-driven TIPSY rules for TSA processing; missing
  config now fails fast with explicit guidance, while `FEMIC_TIPSY_USE_LEGACY=1` preserves an
  opt-in escape hatch to legacy in-code rule dispatch during transition.
- Added `femic tipsy validate` CLI command for preflight validation of TSA YAML handoff files
  (all discovered configs, or explicit `--tsa` subset), including missing-file detection and schema
  checks via shared `tipsy_config` loader/validator helpers.
- Reduced notebook-script global coupling at the 00/01a/01b stage boundary:
  `01a_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` and `01b_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` now take explicit runtime arguments
  (`tsa`, and for 01a also `stratum_col`, `f`, `si_levels`, `vdyp_out_cache`, fit/wrap hooks),
  and `00_data-prep.py` now passes these values directly instead of setting module globals.
- Replaced broad `module.__dict__.update(globals())` handoff with explicit, validated context
  binding via `femic.pipeline.legacy_context.bind_legacy_module_context(...)` and scoped symbol
  lists (`RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS`, `RUN_01B_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS`) so 01a/01b receive only required
  shared notebook-state dependencies.
- Extracted VDYP batch prep/run/import orchestration into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.execute_vdyp_batch(...)` (input CSV staging, subprocess execution,
  stdout/stderr artifact appends, parse/error/status event logging), and rewired `01a_run-tsa.py`
  `run_vdyp` internals to call this shared stage helper.
- Added focused unit tests for the VDYP stage helper (`tests/test_vdyp_stage.py`) covering success,
  parse-error, and timeout paths with deterministic fake runner/importer hooks.
- Extracted bootstrap-dispatch orchestration from `01a_run-tsa.py` into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.execute_bootstrap_vdyp_runs(...)` (per stratum+SI context assembly,
  dispatch/dispatch_error logging, and nested result-table accumulation), and rewired the
  `force_run_vdyp` branch to consume this helper.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with bootstrap orchestration coverage for success and
  dispatch-error logging behavior.
- Extracted curve-smoothing dispatch orchestration from `01a_run-tsa.py` into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.execute_curve_smoothing_runs(...)`, centralizing per stratum+SI
  missing-output warnings, `process_vdyp_out(...)` invocation, and curve-context event emission.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to consume `execute_curve_smoothing_runs(...)` and build
  `vdyp_smoothxy` tables from returned smoothed-curve records before writing
  `vdyp_curves_smooth-tsa{tsa}.feather`.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with curve-smoothing orchestration coverage, including
  missing-VDYP warning logging and kwarg-override forwarding into `process_vdyp_out(...)`.
- Extracted legacy VDYP overlay plotting into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.plot_curve_overlays(...)`, so `01a_run-tsa.py` now delegates the
  per-stratum plotting loop to a shared stage helper while preserving existing plot output shape.
- Reduced required 01a legacy context symbols by removing no-longer-used globals
  (`Path`, `curve_fit`, `shlex`, `subprocess`) from `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS`.
- Added `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` coverage for overlay plotting orchestration
  (`plot_curve_overlays`) to assert expected plotting calls and axis/legend handling.
- Extracted the remaining smooth-curve table assembly/write path into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.build_smoothed_curve_table(...)`, so `01a_run-tsa.py` now delegates
  smoothed-curve DataFrame construction + optional feather persistence through a shared stage helper.
- Removed additional stale 01a legacy context symbols after extraction (`_curve_fit`, `wraps`)
  from `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS`.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with `build_smoothed_curve_table(...)` coverage to verify
  row assembly and output-path write invocation behavior.
- Extracted VDYP result-resolution branching (`force_run`, per-TSA cache load, combined-cache
  fallback, bootstrap-and-persist) into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.load_or_build_vdyp_results_tsa(...)`, and rewired `01a_run-tsa.py`
  to delegate this cache/bootstrap decision path through the shared stage helper.
- Reduced required 01a legacy context symbols again by removing stale `pickle` dependency from
  `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS`.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with coverage for `load_or_build_vdyp_results_tsa(...)`
  across force-run, TSA-cache, combined-cache, and compat-loader fallback branches.
- Extracted VDYP polygon/layer table loading into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.load_vdyp_input_tables(...)` and rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to use this
  helper instead of inline source/feather branch code.
- Reduced required 01a legacy context symbols again by removing stale `gpd` dependency from
  `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS`.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with `load_vdyp_input_tables(...)` coverage for both feather
  cache loads and source-geodatabase load+persist behavior.
- Added `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.build_curve_fit_adapter(...)` and rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to
  construct a local `curve_fit` wrapper from `curve_fit_impl` so legacy `maxfev` kwargs map to
  modern SciPy `max_nfev` without per-call inline wrapper logic.
- Removed obsolete `wraps_impl` plumbing from `01a_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` and the
  `00_data-prep.py` caller now that curve-fit adaptation is centralized in the stage helper.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with `build_curve_fit_adapter(...)` coverage for both
  `maxfev -> max_nfev` conversion and passthrough when `max_nfev` is already supplied.
- Reduced additional 01a global-state coupling by extending `01a_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` with
  explicit path/export inputs (`vdyp_results_*`, `vdyp_input_pandl_path`,
  `vdyp_{ply,lyr}_feather_path`, `tipsy_params_columns`, `tipsy_params_path_prefix`) and wiring
  `00_data-prep.py` to pass them directly.
- Trimmed `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS` after this signature change by removing no-longer-needed path
  and TIPSY-export globals (`vdyp_input_pandl_path`, `vdyp_{ply,lyr}_feather_path`,
  `vdyp_results_*`, `tipsy_params_columns`, `tipsy_params_path_prefix`).
- Extended `01a_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` again to take the mutable per-run data structures
  (`results`, `vdyp_results`, `vdyp_curves_smooth`, `scsi_au`, `au_scsi`, `tipsy_params`) and
  lookup inputs (`si_levelquants`, `species_list`,
  `vdyp_curves_smooth_tsa_feather_path_prefix`) explicitly from `00_data-prep.py`.
- Trimmed `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS` further after this handoff update, leaving only baseline
  runtime/module helpers (`np`, `pd`, `plt`, `sns`, `os`, `operator`, `itertools`, `distance`,
  `kwarg_overrides`, `_femic_resume_effective`) instead of dataset/state payload globals.
- Converted `01b_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` to explicit runtime inputs
  (`results`, `au_scsi`, `tipsy_curves`, `vdyp_curves_smooth`) and updated `00_data-prep.py` to
  pass these directly instead of relying on injected module globals.
- Removed all remaining 01b context injection requirements by setting
  `RUN_01B_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS` to an empty tuple and localizing 01b plotting imports
  (`matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`) inside the function.
- Extracted TIPSY export assembly/writes from `01a_run-tsa.py` into reusable
  `femic.pipeline.tipsy` helpers (`build_tipsy_input_table`, `write_tipsy_input_exports`) and
  rewired the legacy script to delegate xlsx/dat output generation through these helpers.
- Expanded `tests/test_tipsy.py` with coverage for new TIPSY export helpers: row/column assembly,
  empty-input failure behavior, and xlsx/dat artifact writes.
- Extracted config-vs-legacy TIPSY rule-selection into
  `femic.pipeline.tipsy_config.resolve_tipsy_param_builder(...)` and rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to
  call this helper for builder/message resolution.
- Expanded `tests/test_tipsy_config.py` with resolver coverage for config-preferred, forced-legacy,
  and missing-config error paths.
- Localized remaining non-numeric helper imports used by `01a_run-tsa.py` (`distance`,
  `itertools`, `operator`, `os`) inside `run_tsa(...)`, removing these dependencies on injected
  legacy module globals.
- Trimmed `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS` again after import localization; 01a context binding now
  requires only `_femic_resume_effective`, `kwarg_overrides`, and plotting/dataframe modules
  (`np`, `pd`, `plt`, `sns`).
- Extracted the TIPSY candidate-selection and AU-assignment loop from `01a_run-tsa.py` into
  `femic.pipeline.tipsy.build_tipsy_params_for_tsa(...)`, including eligibility filtering, warning
  event emission, and final `scsi_au`/`au_scsi`/`tipsy_params` map construction.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` to consume `build_tipsy_params_for_tsa(...)` and pass
  explicit runtime flags (`resume_effective`, `force_run_vdyp`, `kwarg_overrides_for_tsa`) from
  `00_data-prep.py` instead of reading injected globals.
- Localized `numpy`/`pandas`/`matplotlib`/`seaborn` imports inside `01a_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` and
  trimmed `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS` to an empty tuple; both 01a and 01b now run without required
  legacy context payload injection.
- Expanded `tests/test_tipsy.py` with orchestration coverage for
  `build_tipsy_params_for_tsa(...)` (success mapping, missing-VDYP warning, no-species warning).
- Extracted inline legacy TSA rule builders/exclusion setup from `01a_run-tsa.py` into new
  `femic.pipeline.tipsy_legacy` module (`build_tipsy_exclusion`,
  `get_legacy_tipsy_builders`, `tipsy_params_tsa08/16/24/40/41`) and rewired 01a to consume this
  shared seam.
- Added `tests/test_tipsy_legacy.py` coverage for legacy builder-dispatch keys, exclusion-map keys,
  and baseline TSA08 output fields.
- Added runtime-wiring regression tests in `tests/test_legacy_context.py` asserting
  `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS == ()` and `RUN_01B_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS == ()`, plus empty-required-symbol
  binding behavior.
- Removed no-op legacy context binding calls from `00_data-prep.py` now that both
  `RUN_01A_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS` and `RUN_01B_CONTEXT_SYMBOLS` are empty; 01a/01b module loading now
  proceeds directly to explicit `run_tsa(...)` invocation.
- Removed the inactive `if 0:` legacy TIPSY export branch from `01a_run-tsa.py` (unused duplicate
  xlsx assembly path) to keep only the active helper-driven export flow.
- Pruned deprecated legacy-context re-exports from `femic.pipeline.__init__` now that context
  injection is no longer part of the runtime orchestration surface.
- Removed additional low-risk inactive `if 0:` debug/reload blocks from `00_data-prep.py`
  (checkpoint rollbacks/manual cache toggles/legacy shp export snippets) to reduce notebook-era
  dead-code noise without altering active runtime branches.
- Added `tests/test_legacy_orchestration_wiring.py` AST regression checks to lock explicit
  `_run01a_module.run_tsa(...)` and `_run01b_module.run_tsa(...)` keyword handoff surfaces and
  assert no `bind_legacy_module_context(...)` call remains in `00_data-prep.py`.
- Removed the final inactive `if 0:` notebook-era debug blocks from `00_data-prep.py` (dormant
  legacy `process_vdyp_out(...)` sandbox and manual TSA smoothing loop), leaving only active
  orchestration code paths.
- Expanded `tests/test_tipsy_legacy.py` with a TSA24 regression case that verifies BEC-dependent
  legacy rule branching (`SBS` vs `ESSF`) for a fir-leading stand.
- Extracted default VDYP curve-smoothing kwarg overrides into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_overrides` (`DEFAULT_VDYP_KWARG_OVERRIDES`,
  `vdyp_kwarg_overrides_for_tsa(...)`) to remove hardcoded override dicts from
  `00_data-prep.py` and centralize override defaults in a reusable pipeline seam.
- Updated `01a_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` to resolve override defaults internally when
  `kwarg_overrides_for_tsa` is not provided; `00_data-prep.py` now passes `None` explicitly.
- Added regression coverage for the new override helper (`tests/test_vdyp_overrides.py`) plus AST
  wiring coverage asserting the 00->01a handoff uses internal defaults
  (`kwarg_overrides_for_tsa=None`).
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to consume `femic.pipeline.tsa.target_nstrata_for(...)` instead of an
  inline TSA->target-strata dict, reducing notebook-era duplicated constants.
- Added shared `femic.pipeline.tsa.MIN_STANDCOUNT` and updated 01a strata filtering/tests to consume
  this constant instead of hardcoded local values.
- Removed additional inline bootstrap tuning constants from `01a_run-tsa.py` by relying on
  `execute_bootstrap_vdyp_runs(...)` defaults for `half_rel_ci`, `nsamples_c1`, and `ipp_mode`.
- Added `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` AST guardrails that lock 01a structural cleanup:
  `run_tsa(...)` must call `target_nstrata_for(...)`, must not reintroduce an inline
  `target_nstrata` dict assignment, and must not locally reassign `si_levels`.
- Extracted 01a strata summarization logic into `femic.pipeline.tsa.build_strata_summary(...)`
  (target-strata selection, site-index/crown-closure/coverage aggregates, stand-count filtering,
  and `median_si` enrichment), reducing notebook-era inline grouping logic in `run_tsa(...)`.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to consume `build_strata_summary(...)` for stratum candidate table
  assembly and IQR reporting.
- Expanded `tests/test_pipeline_helpers.py` with deterministic `build_strata_summary(...)` coverage
  (aggregate outputs + validation error path), and updated `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py`
  guardrails to assert `run_tsa(...)` calls the extracted helper seam.
- Extracted 01a lexmatch alias resolution into
  `femic.pipeline.tsa.build_stratum_lexmatch_alias_map(...)`, moving Levenshtein tie-break
  selection logic (distance + relative-area tiebreak) out of inline notebook-era code.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to consume `build_stratum_lexmatch_alias_map(...)` when mapping
  non-selected strata onto selected strata for downstream fitting.
- Expanded tests with deterministic alias-map coverage in `tests/test_pipeline_helpers.py`, and
  added AST guardrails in `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` asserting 01a calls the new
  lexmatch helper seam.
- Extracted the inline 01a stratum-fitting block into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.fit_stratum_curves(...)`, centralizing per-SI quantile filtering,
  species-share derivation, curve-fit execution/error handling, and optional plot emission in a
  reusable stage seam.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to call `fit_stratum_curves(...)` during pre-VDYP stratum compilation,
  removing the nested `fit_stratum(...)` function definition from `run_tsa(...)`.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with focused `fit_stratum_curves(...)` coverage (successful
  species payload output and curve-fit error skip/log behavior), and extended
  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` guardrails to assert 01a calls the stage helper and no
  longer defines a nested `fit_stratum`.
- Extracted stratum-compilation loop orchestration into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.compile_strata_fit_results(...)`, so 01a now delegates per-stratum
  iteration/message/result assembly through a reusable stage helper.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` pre-VDYP compilation path to call
  `compile_strata_fit_results(...)` with the extracted `fit_stratum_curves(...)` seam.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with deterministic compile-loop helper coverage, and extended
  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` guardrails to assert 01a calls
  `compile_strata_fit_results(...)`.
- Extracted VDYP sampling-mode orchestration into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.run_vdyp_sampling(...)`, centralizing the `auto`/`all`/fixed sample
  flow, cache-hit handling, and gap-fill loop decision logic previously embedded in 01a.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` `run_vdyp(...)` to delegate sampling decisions through
  `run_vdyp_sampling(...)` while keeping batch execution/logging in its existing `_run_vdyp(...)`
  closure.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with focused `run_vdyp_sampling(...)` coverage
  (auto-small-sample path, auto gap-fill phase path, and invalid-mode assertion), and extended
  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` guardrails to assert 01a calls
  `run_vdyp_sampling(...)`.
- Extracted the nested 01a `run_vdyp(...)` wrapper into
  `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.run_vdyp_for_stratum(...)`, centralizing per-stratum VDYP runtime
  preflight checks (wine/bin/params), default log-path resolution, run-event logging, batch
  execution dispatch, and sampling orchestration handoff.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` bootstrap execution to call `run_vdyp_for_stratum(...)` directly and
  removed the nested `run_vdyp` and `_tsa_log_path` definitions from `run_tsa(...)`.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with `run_vdyp_for_stratum(...)` coverage and updated
  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` guardrails to assert 01a no longer calls
  `run_vdyp_sampling(...)` directly and no longer defines a nested `run_vdyp`.
- Queued next extraction slice: move the remaining 01a bootstrap-callable wiring lambda into a
  dedicated stage helper so `run_tsa(...)` only passes explicit orchestration inputs without
  inline closure assembly.
- Added `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.build_run_vdyp_for_stratum_runner(...)`, a reusable helper that
  binds per-TSA runtime context (`tsa`, `run_id`, VDYP tables, fit hooks, and run-log paths) into
  a `run_vdyp_fn(sample_table, **kwargs)` callable compatible with
  `execute_bootstrap_vdyp_runs(...)`.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` bootstrap flow to build `run_vdyp_fn` via
  `build_run_vdyp_for_stratum_runner(...)`, removing the remaining inline lambda that assembled
  `run_vdyp_for_stratum(...)` kwargs inside `run_tsa(...)`.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with binding/forwarding coverage for
  `build_run_vdyp_for_stratum_runner(...)`, and updated
  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` guardrails to assert 01a calls the builder helper and no
  longer calls `run_vdyp_for_stratum(...)` directly.
- Queued next extraction slice: remove the remaining inline `run_bootstrap_fn=lambda: ...`
  assembly in `01a_run-tsa.py` by introducing a dedicated stage helper for per-TSA bootstrap
  callback construction.
- Added `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.build_bootstrap_vdyp_results_runner(...)`, a reusable helper
  that binds per-TSA bootstrap dispatch inputs (`tsa`, `run_id`, results payload, SI levels, log
  sink, `run_vdyp_fn`, and cache map) into a zero-arg callback compatible with
  `load_or_build_vdyp_results_tsa(...)`.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to pass `run_bootstrap_fn` built by
  `build_bootstrap_vdyp_results_runner(...)`, removing the remaining inline
  `run_bootstrap_fn=lambda: execute_bootstrap_vdyp_runs(...)` closure assembly.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with binding/forwarding coverage for
  `build_bootstrap_vdyp_results_runner(...)`, and updated
  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` guardrails to assert 01a calls the builder helper and does
  not pass an inline lambda to `run_bootstrap_fn`.
- Queued next extraction slice: move the remaining inline `compile_one_fn=lambda: ...` assembly in
  pre-VDYP stratum compilation into a dedicated stage helper so 01a no longer builds fit-call
  closures inline.
- Added `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.build_fit_stratum_curves_runner(...)`, a reusable helper that
  binds per-TSA stratum-fit context into `compile_one_fn(stratumi, sc)` callbacks for
  `compile_strata_fit_results(...)`.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to build and pass `compile_one_fn` via
  `build_fit_stratum_curves_runner(...)`, removing inline fit-call closure assembly in the pre-VDYP
  compilation path.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with fit-runner binding coverage and updated
  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` guardrails so 01a must call the builder helper and must not
  pass inline lambdas to `compile_one_fn`.
- Extracted legacy notebook fit functions (`fit_func1`, `fit_func1_bounds_func`, `fit_func2`,
  `fit_func2_bounds_func`) from `01a_run-tsa.py` into `femic.pipeline.vdyp_curves`
  (`legacy_fit_func1`, `legacy_fit_func1_bounds_func`, `legacy_fit_func2`,
  `legacy_fit_func2_bounds_func`), and rewired 01a to consume these shared helpers.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_curves.py` with deterministic coverage for legacy fit-function outputs
  and bounds, and added AST guardrails asserting 01a no longer defines nested legacy fit functions.
- Queued next extraction slice: remove the final nested `match_stratum(...)` function definition in
  `01a_run-tsa.py` by moving alias-application logic into a reusable TSA helper.
- Added `femic.pipeline.tsa.apply_stratum_alias_map(...)` to encapsulate selected-strata retention
  plus alias fallback assignment for `*_matched` stratum columns.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to call `apply_stratum_alias_map(...)` for stratum matching, removing
  the final nested helper definition (`match_stratum`) from `run_tsa(...)`.
- Expanded `tests/test_pipeline_helpers.py` with deterministic alias-application coverage and added
  AST guardrails in `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` asserting 01a calls the helper and has no
  nested `match_stratum`.
- `01a_run-tsa.run_tsa(...)` now has zero nested function definitions; remaining extraction focus is
  reducing inline notebook-style constant/plot configuration blocks into reusable stage helpers.
- Queued next extraction slice: move curve-smoothing plot setup constants
  (`palette_flavours`/palette/alpha defaults) from `01a_run-tsa.py` into a shared stage helper.
- Added `femic.pipeline.vdyp_stage.CurveSmoothingPlotConfig` and
  `build_curve_smoothing_plot_config(...)` to centralize legacy curve-smoothing plot defaults
  (plot toggle, `figsize`, palette setup, `palette_flavours`, `alphas`) behind a shared stage seam.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` curve-smoothing overlay path to call
  `build_curve_smoothing_plot_config(...)` and consume the returned config instead of defining
  inline plot/palette constants.
- Expanded `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` with deterministic defaults coverage for
  `build_curve_smoothing_plot_config(...)`, and added AST guardrails in
  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` asserting 01a calls this helper and no longer assigns
  inline smoothing `palette_flavours`/`alphas` constants.
- Queued next extraction slice: remove dead legacy `fit_func2`/`fit_func2_bounds_func` local
  bindings from `01a_run-tsa.py` now that these values are no longer consumed by any active stage.
- Removed dead `legacy_fit_func2`/`legacy_fit_func2_bounds_func` imports and local
  `fit_func2`/`fit_func2_bounds_func` assignments from `01a_run-tsa.py`; these values were no
  longer used by any active stage path after prior smoothing-stage extraction.
- Added `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` guardrails asserting `run_tsa(...)` no longer assigns
  local legacy fit2 bindings.
- Queued next extraction slice: move inline TIPSY staging defaults
  (`min_operable_years`, `si_iqrlo_quantile`, local `verbose`) into a shared helper seam so 01a no
  longer embeds these constants directly.
- Removed inline TIPSY staging constant assignments from `01a_run-tsa.py`
  (`min_operable_years`, `si_iqrlo_quantile`, local `verbose`) and now rely on
  `build_tipsy_params_for_tsa(...)` shared default thresholds.
- Expanded `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` with guardrails asserting 01a no longer assigns
  these constants inline and no longer overrides corresponding
  `build_tipsy_params_for_tsa(...)` keyword defaults.
- Queued next extraction slice: move overlay axis-bound constants (`xlim`, `ylim`) passed to
  `plot_curve_overlays(...)` out of `01a_run-tsa.py` into a shared stage/default helper.
- Extended `CurveSmoothingPlotConfig` / `build_curve_smoothing_plot_config(...)` to include overlay
  axis defaults (`xlim`, `ylim`) so smoothing overlay bounds are configured in one shared stage
  seam.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` `plot_curve_overlays(...)` call to consume
  `smooth_plot_cfg.xlim`/`smooth_plot_cfg.ylim` instead of inline tuple literals.

  complete (00/01a/01b script entrypoints, VDYP/Wine diagnostics hardening, config-driven TIPSY
  handoff, and broad 01a helper extraction); active work remains in Phase 2 (`P2.1b`/`P2.2`) to
  remove residual inline globals/path templates and tighten stage orchestration seams.
- Planned execution sequence after transcript review:
  1) extract remaining 01a inline path templates into shared helpers, 2) trim stale 01a imports and
  dependency injection leftovers, 3) finish converting any residual inline stage logic to helper
  calls with AST guardrails, 4) run full validation gate and capture a new end-to-end TSA debug run
  summary in changelog notes.
- Added `femic.pipeline.vdyp.build_vdyp_cache_paths(...)` to centralize per-TSA cache artifact path
  templates for `vdyp_results-tsa*.pkl` and `vdyp_curves_smooth-tsa*.feather`.
- Rewired `01a_run-tsa.py` to call `build_vdyp_cache_paths(...)` instead of constructing per-TSA
  cache paths inline via string templates.

  `tests/test_legacy_01a_structure.py` now asserts 01a calls the helper and no longer assigns
  inline `%`-formatted cache-path templates.

  does not import `os` locally for this path-check stage.
- Queued next extraction slice: reduce remaining 00->01a path handoff plumbing by passing a single
  resolved VDYP cache-path payload instead of separate path-prefix arguments.
- Queued execution batch (post-checklist refresh):
  1) implement a `vdyp_cache_paths` payload handoff from `00_data-prep.py` to `01a_run-tsa.py`,
  2) reduce `run_tsa(...)` argument surface by grouping remaining path/runtime plumbing into a
  typed config payload,
  3) extract 00_data-prep 01a/01b module-loader/caller loops into shared orchestration helper(s).

  logic around stage setup/checkpoints into reusable stage helpers so the top-level script becomes a
  thin workflow shell.
- Added stage setup helpers in `femic.pipeline.stages`:
  `initialize_legacy_tsa_stage_state(...)`, `prepare_tsa_index(...)`, and
  `should_skip_if_outputs_exist(...)`.

  `lookup_scsi_au_base(...)`, `assign_au_ids_from_scsi(...)`,
  `summarize_missing_au_mappings(...)`, `build_au_assignment_null_summary(...)`, and
  `validate_nonempty_au_assignment(...)`.

  loop) instead of inline local function definitions.
- Exported stands helpers from `femic.pipeline.__init__` and added deterministic coverage in
  `tests/test_stands.py`; updated orchestration guardrails in
  `tests/test_legacy_orchestration_wiring.py` to assert

- Queued next extraction slice: continue P2.2 by centralizing remaining `00_data-prep.py` hardcoded
  `./data/...` artifact path literals (checkpoints, intermediates, and exports) behind reusable path
  builders so stage orchestration uses structured path payloads instead of inline strings.

  `build_vdyp_cache_paths(...)` + `tipsy_params_excel_path(...)` now drive 01a resume-skip output
  checks; siteprod layer temp paths now use `Path` joins/globs instead of `%s` string templates.
- Replaced residual string-shell path checks/builds in this stage:

- Completed validation gate after this slice:
  `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest` (240 passed),
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`.
- Queued next extraction slice: continue P2.2 by evaluating whether `process_vdyp_out(...)`
  (`src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_curves.py`) can adopt shared timestamped event builder without
  changing its intentional single-base-event timestamp semantics; if not, explicitly document that
  rationale and mark this consolidation sub-track complete.
- Completed the queued `vdyp_curves.py` evaluation and successfully adopted shared event helpers
  without changing its single-base-event timestamp semantics: `process_vdyp_out(...)` now builds its
  base event via shared `build_timestamped_event(...)` exactly once per run and reuses that payload
  across emitted events.
- Extended `build_timestamped_event(...)` (`src/femic/pipeline/diagnostics.py`) to support optional
  `status` and explicit `timestamp` override so both per-event and base-event patterns are supported
  through one helper.
- Expanded deterministic coverage in `tests/test_diagnostics.py` for status-optional event payloads
  and validated `tests/test_vdyp_curves.py` against the rewired base-event construction path.
- Completed validation gate after this slice:
  `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest` (241 passed),
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`.
- Queued next extraction slice: continue P2.2 by closing the event-consolidation sub-track with a
  quick repo-wide audit for remaining ad hoc `event` + `timestamp` payload construction in
  production code and either (a) rewire to shared diagnostics helpers or (b) document explicit
  exceptions where intentional.
- Closed the queued event-consolidation audit by rewiring the final ad hoc structured event path in
  `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_curves.py` (`vdyp_curve_anchor`) to shared
  `build_timestamped_event(...)` while preserving one-timestamp-per-run semantics.
- Extended `build_timestamped_event(...)` (`src/femic/pipeline/diagnostics.py`) to support optional
  `status` and explicit timestamp override, enabling both per-event and base-event reuse patterns.
- Added `build_vdyp_stream_header(...)` in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_logging.py` and rewired
  `execute_vdyp_batch(...)` (`src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py`) to consume it, removing the last
  inline timestamped stream-header string assembly from execution flow.
- Expanded deterministic coverage in `tests/test_diagnostics.py`, `tests/test_vdyp_curves.py`, and
  `tests/test_vdyp_logging.py` for the rewired helpers and timestamp-semantics guard.

  `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest` (242 passed),
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`.
- Queued next extraction slice: continue P2.2 by reducing duplicated fallback-event assembly inside
  `process_vdyp_out(...)` (`src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_curves.py`) via a small internal event-builder
  seam that reuses shared diagnostics helpers without changing emitted fields.
- Reduced duplicated fallback-event assembly in `process_vdyp_out(...)`
  (`src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_curves.py`) by adding a small internal `emit_curve_event(...)` seam that
  reuses shared diagnostics event helpers while preserving emitted field sets and timestamp/context
  semantics.
- Rewired all `process_vdyp_out(...)` event emissions (fallback, body-fit error, toe-fit success,
  toe-fit warning, quasi-origin anchor) through the new internal seam; behavior remains unchanged.
- Completed validation gate after this slice:
  `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest` (242 passed),
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`.
- Queued next extraction slice: continue P2.2 by auditing duplicate formatting/serialization logic in
  logging helpers (`append_jsonl`, stream-header and related callers) for additional safe
  centralization seams now that event payload assembly is consolidated.
- Consolidated duplicate logging-format/serialization logic in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_logging.py`
  by introducing `serialize_jsonl_payload(...)` and `append_line(...)`, then rewiring
  `append_jsonl(...)` to use these shared seams.
- Preserved existing external behavior (`default=str` JSON serialization and newline-terminated line
  append semantics) while removing repeated parent-dir + line-write patterns.
- Expanded deterministic coverage in `tests/test_vdyp_logging.py` for payload serialization and
  generic line-appending helpers.
- Completed validation gate after this slice:
  `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest` (244 passed),
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`.
- Queued next extraction slice: continue P2.2 by auditing whether remaining specialized appenders
  (plain-text stream append and JSONL append callsites) can share a single file-append primitive
  end-to-end without reducing clarity or changing output contract.
- Completed the queued append-primitive audit in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_logging.py` by adding a
  shared internal file-append helper (`_append_text_fragment(...)`) and rewiring both
  `append_line(...)` and `append_text(...)` to consume it.
- Preserved output contracts: `append_line(...)` still appends newline-terminated records and
  `append_text(...)` still appends exact text fragments.
- Expanded deterministic coverage in `tests/test_vdyp_logging.py` with
  `test_append_text_appends_without_overwriting` to guard append-vs-overwrite behavior.
- Completed validation gate after this slice:
  `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest` (245 passed),
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`.
- Queued next extraction slice: continue P2.2 by auditing remaining direct append-file writes
  outside `vdyp_logging`/`append_line` callsites and centralizing them only where behavior can
  remain byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Completed the queued direct-append audit across production Python paths (`src/`,
  `00_data-prep.py`, `01a_run-tsa.py`, `01b_run-tsa.py`): no remaining direct file-append writes
  exist outside `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_logging.py`.
- Confirmed the only append-file primitive in production code is now
  `_append_text_fragment(...)` via `append_line(...)`/`append_text(...)`; no behavior-preserving
  rewires were needed in this slice.
- Completed validation gate after this slice:
  `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest` (245 passed),
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`.

  line-forwarded legacy subprocess output and VDYP stream artifact capture.
- Added `stream_filtered_subprocess_output(...)` in `src/femic/pipeline/stages.py` and rewired
  `run_legacy_subprocess(...)` to consume this helper, preserving line text/newline behavior while
  centralizing known-noise filtering.
- Added `build_vdyp_stream_log_block(...)` in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_logging.py` and rewired
  `execute_vdyp_batch(...)` (`src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py`) to use it for both stdout/stderr
  stream block assembly (`header + stream + trailing newline`), removing duplicated inline framing.
- Expanded deterministic coverage in `tests/test_pipeline_stages.py` and
  `tests/test_vdyp_logging.py` for these new stream-formatting helper seams.
- Completed validation gate after this slice:

  `collect_vdyp_batch_run_metadata(...)` (shared returncode/duration/file-size/head capture).
- Rewired `execute_vdyp_batch(...)` to consume these helpers for timeout/error/parse-error/ok

- Added regression assertions in `tests/test_legacy_manifest.py` for runtime-parameter sections and
  seed/config provenance values.
- Marked `P3.4` complete now that deterministic seed control and runtime parameter/version metadata
  capture are both implemented.
- Queued next extraction slice (ASAP closure path): start `P3.5a` by updating README workflow docs
  to reflect run-config profiles, manifest provenance fields, and deterministic sampling controls.
- Closed `P3.5a` by updating `README.md` workflow documentation for config-driven runs
  (`--run-config`), deterministic sampling control (`FEMIC_SAMPLING_SEED`), and manifest metadata
  sections used for reproducibility/audit.
- Closed `P3.5b` by adding a concise end-to-end quickstart flow in `README.md` covering
  CLI help check, TIPSY config validation, single-TSA run, and VDYP diagnostics reporting.
- Marked `P3.5` complete now that workflow handoff docs and quickstart are both in place.
- Queued next extraction slice (ASAP closure path): run a final roadmap consistency pass and
  prepare branch for merge/deployment handoff.
- Completed final roadmap consistency pass: all Phase 1/2/3 checklist items are now checked,
  including parent closeout for `P2.1` (its sub-items were already complete).
- Branch is ready for merge/deployment handoff.
- Added `planning/TSA29_dataset_compile_plan.md` with an explicit runbook for compiling TSA 29,
  including the required `config/tipsy/tsa29.yaml` gate, config-driven run steps, diagnostics, and
  completion criteria.
- Debugged TSA29 TIPSY config bring-up blocker: replaced species-whitelist rule with a catch-all
  rule (`when: {}`) and added null defaults for optional schema columns (`SPP_2..5`, `PCT_2..5`,
  `GW_*`, `GW_age_*`) so `tipsy_params_columns` projection succeeds.
- Re-ran TIPSY stage directly from cached TSA29 artifacts (`vdyp_prep-tsa29.pkl`,
  `vdyp_results-tsa29.pkl`, `vdyp_curves_smooth-tsa29.feather`) and regenerated
  `data/tipsy_params_tsa29.xlsx` + `data/02_input-tsa29.dat` with 30 AU rows (10 strata x 3 SI).
- Immediate next queue: have user run BatchTIPSY against `data/02_input-tsa29.dat`, upload
  `data/04_output-tsa29.out`, then execute 01b/post-01b assembly to validate full end-to-end TSA29
  compile.
- Added a dedicated downstream CLI recovery path for manual BatchTIPSY handoff:
  `python -m femic tsa post-tipsy --tsa <code> [-v]`.
- Implemented `run_post_tipsy_bundle(...)` in `src/femic/workflows/legacy.py` to run 01b from
  cached TSA artifacts (`vdyp_prep-tsaXX.pkl`, `vdyp_curves_smooth-tsaXX.feather`) and rebuild
  `data/model_input_bundle/{au_table,curve_table,curve_points_table}.csv` without re-running the
  full 00/01a front-half.
- Added regression coverage for command wiring and downstream assembly in
  `tests/test_cli_main.py` and `tests/test_workflows_post_tipsy.py`.
- Immediate next queue: polish 01b runtime warnings (deprecated
  `delim_whitespace`, figure-close loop, lexsort warnings) and add a run manifest entry for the
  new `tsa post-tipsy` command.
- Added targeted `vdyp_io` ignore rules in `.gitignore` for generated scratch artifacts
  (`vdyp_err_*`, `vdyp_out_*`, `vdyp_ply_*`, `vdyp_lyr_*`, and tmp dirs/files) so `git status`
  stays clean while retaining tracked `vdyp_io/VDYP_CFG` assets.
- Updated ignore strategy to also exclude volatile local `vdyp_io/VDYP_CFG` runtime files
  (`VDYP7_BACK.ctl`, `VDYP7_VDYP.ctl`, `vdyp7.log`) and untracked them from git index so repeated
  model runs no longer generate persistent dirty-state churn.
- Closed queued runtime-noise cleanup for 01b:
  replaced deprecated `delim_whitespace` parsing with `sep="\\s+"`, pre-sorted the VDYP curve
  MultiIndex once before per-AU plotting, and added explicit `plt.close(fig)` in the loop to
  prevent figure accumulation warnings during `tsa post-tipsy` runs.
- Closed queued run-manifest/audit logging for `femic tsa post-tipsy`:
  added workflow-level manifest emission (`started`/`ok`/`failed`) with runtime metadata + output
  artifact checks, and wired CLI `--run-id`/`--log-dir` through the command.
- Started TSA29 TIPSY rule quality tuning: replaced single-species catch-all behavior with ordered
  provisional BEC/species-group rules (pine, fir, spruce, balsam pathways) including species mixes,
  adjusted density/utilization, and modest GW settings while preserving final catch-all coverage.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_tipsy_config.py` for key TSA29 rule matches
  (MS pine pathway and IDF fir pathway).
- Regenerated `data/tipsy_params_tsa29.xlsx` + `data/02_input-tsa29.dat` from cached TSA29
  artifacts using the tuned ruleset so next BatchTIPSY run can proceed immediately.
- Remaining immediate queue: run BatchTIPSY with the new TSA29 input, re-run
  `femic tsa post-tipsy --tsa 29`, then add managed-vs-unmanaged curve-dominance regression
  assertions from the refreshed outputs.
- Upgraded TSA29 TIPSY parameter rules to TSR-anchored assumptions using Williams Lake data
  package references:
  `reference/29ts_dpkg_2024-2.pdf` (Section 8.5) and
  `reference/williams_lake_tsa_data_package-2.pdf` (Section 6.3 Tables 23–25).
- Updated `config/tipsy/tsa29.yaml` from provisional heuristics to ordered BEC/species pathways
  with explicit treated/untreated proportions, regeneration delays, species mixes, densities, and
  genetic-worth values aligned to TSR assumptions, while preserving catch-all coverage.
- Synced TSA29 config tests in `tests/test_tipsy_config.py` to the new rule expectations.
- Fixed a TSA29 resume-path loader defect in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py` by adding
  fallback reads for plain Feather caches lacking GeoPandas metadata.
- Forced 01a rerun for TSA29 and regenerated `data/02_input-tsa29.dat` from cached artifacts
  under the new ruleset (30 AU rows retained; values changed materially).
- Immediate next queue:
  user runs BatchTIPSY with regenerated `data/02_input-tsa29.dat`, uploads refreshed
  `data/04_output-tsa29.out`, then we run
  `python -m femic tsa post-tipsy --tsa 29 --run-id <id> -v`
  and validate refreshed `tipsy_vdyp_tsa29-*.png` behavior.
- Added custom management-unit boundary mode for `femic run` profiles:
  `selection.boundary_path`, `selection.boundary_layer`, and `selection.boundary_code`
  now flow from run profile to legacy execution env (`FEMIC_BOUNDARY_*`).
- Implemented boundary-mode extraction in `00_data-prep.py`:
  when `FEMIC_BOUNDARY_PATH` is set, FEMIC unions that layer geometry and uses it as the
  VRI mask for the selected run code (e.g., `k3z`), forcing no-cache execution.
- Added a complete K3Z test-case scaffold:
  `config/run_profile.k3z.yaml`, `config/tipsy/tsak3z.yaml`, and
  `planning/K3Z_dataset_compile_plan.md`.
- Extended TIPSY config discovery/validation to support non-numeric case codes
  (`tsak3z.yaml`) in addition to numeric TSA configs.
- Removed numeric-TSA assumptions in downstream ID assembly by introducing a deterministic
  named-code AU prefix path in `src/femic/pipeline/bundle.py` and `src/femic/pipeline/tsa.py`.
- Ran smoke execution for K3Z (`--debug-rows 20`, no BatchTIPSY output yet):
  run completed and emitted manifest
  `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_smoke5_20260304_221317.json`,
  generating `data/02_input-tsak3z.dat` and `data/tipsy_params_tsak3z.xlsx`.
- Immediate next queue:
  run full K3Z step 1a without debug-row truncation, then user runs BatchTIPSY on
  `data/02_input-tsak3z.dat`, uploads `data/04_output-tsak3z.out`, and we execute
  `python -m femic tsa post-tipsy --tsa k3z --run-id <id> -v`.
- Hardened config-driven TIPSY mix output (`src/femic/pipeline/tipsy_config.py`) to eliminate
  known BatchTIPSY failure patterns in treated rows:
  normalize `SX -> SW`, drop treated broadleaf species from `f` mixes, enforce descending
  species order (dominant species in `SPP_1`), and force exact integer composition sums to 100.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_tipsy_config.py` for mix normalization and TSA29 rule
  behavior (`AT`/`SX` removed from treated `f` rows, dominant species promoted to `SPP_1`,
  `% composition == 100`).
- Validation gate completed for this slice:
  `.venv/bin/ruff format src tests`, `.venv/bin/ruff check src tests`,
  `.venv/bin/mypy src`, `.venv/bin/pytest`, `.venv/bin/pre-commit run --all-files`.
- Immediate next queue:
  regenerate TSA29 step 1a artifacts (`data/tipsy_params_tsa29.xlsx`, `data/02_input-tsa29.dat`)
  from a clean non-stalled run path, then rerun BatchTIPSY and post-tipsy downstream assembly.
- Added config-driven SI tuning support in `src/femic/pipeline/tipsy_config.py`:
  per-side `SI_offset` (or `si_offset`) can now be set in either `defaults.{e,f}` or any
  rule `assign.{e,f}` block; final per-side SI is computed as
  `round(computed_vdyp_si + SI_offset, 1)`.
- Updated TSA29 config defaults to apply a +2.0 managed-side SI bump directly in config:
  `config/tipsy/tsa29.yaml -> defaults.f.SI_offset: 2.0`.
- Added/updated tests in `tests/test_tipsy_config.py` for side-specific SI offset handling
  and TSA29 +2 SI expectations.
- Regenerated TSA29 step-1a artifacts from cached TSA29 prep outputs with the new config:
  `data/tipsy_params_tsa29.xlsx` and `data/02_input-tsa29.dat` now embed the +2 managed SI
  adjustment without manual dat editing.
- Extended TIPSY SI tuning from additive-only to linear transform support in
  `src/femic/pipeline/tipsy_config.py`:
  per-side config can now define `SI_c1` and `SI_c2` (plus lowercase aliases), applied as
  `SI_final = SI_c1 * SI_baseline + SI_c2` (with legacy `SI_offset` still honored).
- Updated TSA29 managed defaults to explicit linear form in `config/tipsy/tsa29.yaml`:
  `defaults.f.SI_c1: 1.0`, `defaults.f.SI_c2: 2.0` (equivalent to fixed +2 SI).
- Added regression tests in `tests/test_tipsy_config.py` for linear SI transform behavior and
  retained backward-compatible SI offset coverage.
- Updated TIPSY config docs/templates:
  `config/tipsy/README.md` and `config/tipsy/template.tsa.yaml` now describe SI linear tuning
  fields and usage.
- Added TSA29 VDYP smoothing override for pathological curve AU 21005 (`SBPS_PL`, `L`) in
  `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_overrides.py`: `skip1=50`.
- Added default per-curve VDYP fit diagnostic plot generation in
  `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py` during smoothing runs:
  each stratum/SI now emits `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsaXX-<stratumi>-<stratum>-<si>.png` showing
  observed 5-year binned median/IQR vs fitted curve.
- Re-ran TSA29 01a/01b and post-tipsy stages to validate integration:
  AU 21005 unmanaged curve corrected from early spike (peak 943.9 @ age 19) to a coherent shape
  (peak 96.3 @ age 223), and fresh overlays/diagnostics were written.
- Extended VDYP smoothing diagnostics in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py` to compare
  three fit flavours per stratum/SI on each default fitdiag PNG:
  baseline/current, sigma-asymmetric candidate, tail-blend candidate, plus conditional
  auto-skip candidate when heuristically detected and validation-approved.
- Extended `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_curves.py` with two candidate-fit controls used by the new
  diagnostics:
  right-tail sigma reweighting (`sigma_right_scale`/`sigma_right_offset`) and optional
  right-tail linear blend (`tail_blend_enabled`, anchor/blend/slope controls).
- Added first-pass auto left-tail anomaly detection in `execute_curve_smoothing_runs(...)`:
  infer suggested `skip1` from early-age overshoot, rerun, and only accept candidate when it
  clears all validation gates (`rmse`, `tail_rmse`, `early_overshoot` vs baseline).
- Ran TSA29 targeted smoothing from cached prep/results artifacts (no full rerun required) and
  regenerated:
  `data/vdyp_curves_smooth-tsa29.feather`,
  `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsa29-*.png` (30 files),
  and comparison summary `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsa29_metrics_compare.csv`.
- Quick quantitative readout from `vdyp_fitdiag_tsa29_metrics_compare.csv`:
  best-overall-RMSE counts across 30 curves were `tail_blend=18`, `sigma_asym=9`, `current=3`;
  best-tail-RMSE counts were `sigma_asym=18`, `tail_blend=9`, `current=3`.
  Auto-skip was suggested in 18 curves but validated in 0 under current strict acceptance gates.
- Follow-up fit-logic revision based on visual QA feedback:
  removed `sigma_asym` candidate from default diagnostics and switched focus to a stronger
  tail-blend approach.
- Updated `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_curves.py` tail blend algorithm to detect a rightmost linear
  binned segment automatically (maximal contiguous tail from the right that meets
  `R² >= tail_linear_min_r2` and `NRMSE <= tail_linear_max_nrmse`), then blend the current NLLS
  curve into that linear tail. If no credible linear tail exists, it naturally falls back to
  raw/current behavior (no tail override).
- New tail controls in `process_vdyp_out(...)`:
  `tail_linear_min_points`, `tail_linear_min_r2`, `tail_linear_max_nrmse`
  (with existing `tail_blend_years` and slope bounds still applied).
- Updated default fitdiag plotting in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py` to show:
  `current`, `tail_blend`, and validated `auto_skip` only.
- Re-ran TSA29 smoothing from cached artifacts and regenerated:
  `data/vdyp_curves_smooth-tsa29.feather`,
  30 plots at `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsa29-*.png`,
  and tail-only comparison summary at
  `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsa29_metrics_tail_only.csv`.
- Tail-only readout on TSA29 (30 curves):
  `tail_blend` improved overall RMSE on 17 curves and improved tail RMSE on 17 curves;
  auto-skip remained suggested in 18 curves.
- Tail-blend failure diagnosis + heuristic correction (2026-03-05 follow-up):
  identified that quantile fallback and non-age-constrained tail selection were still allowing
  early-age pseudo-linear segments to be blended (for example ESSF_SE-L anchoring near age 65),
  causing severe regressions.
- Updated right-tail detection in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_curves.py` to require
  preferred-age tail candidates (`tail_linear_prefer_min_age`, default 200) and skip blending
  entirely when no preferred candidate passes thresholds.
- Kept quantile fallback disabled for TSA29 diagnostic runs
  (`tail_linear_allow_quantile_fallback=False`) so non-linear tails naturally retain
  the current/NLLS curve.
- Regenerated TSA29 fit diagnostics + metrics with the stricter age-aware logic:
  `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsa29-*.png` and
  `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsa29_metrics_tail_only.csv`.
- New outcome (TSA29, 30 curves):
  no catastrophic tail-blend failures remain; worst RMSE regression is now ~0.045
  (`IDF_FDI-L`) instead of multi-unit failures.
- Relaxed-tail detection calibration pass (to capture more long near-linear segments):
  in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py` updated candidate tail thresholds to
  `tail_linear_min_r2=0.82`, `tail_linear_max_nrmse=0.12`,
  `tail_linear_prefer_min_age=190.0`.
- Re-ran TSA29 smoothing + diagnostics with relaxed thresholds:
  tail-blend detection increased from 22/30 to 26/30 curve pairs (4 still intentionally skipped).
- Updated summary (`plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsa29_metrics_tail_only.csv`) shows broader tail capture
  with controlled but non-zero tradeoff:
  `tail_better_rmse=15/30`, `tail_better_tail_rmse=15/30`;
  worst remaining regression is moderate (`IDF_PL-H`, ΔRMSE ~ +0.67), with no catastrophic outliers.
- Added a detailed planning summary of this entire curve-fit enhancement stream at:
  `planning/VDYP_curve_fit_enhancements_2026-03-05.md`, including explicit TODO notes to
  continue tuning tail-fit hyperparameters later.
- Enhanced default fit diagnostic plotting for lecture/demo use:
  `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py` now overlays raw per-sample VDYP curves
  (`Age` vs `Vdwb`) as fine low-alpha grey lines behind binned aggregates/fitted curves.
- Re-ran K3Z with updated fitting/plotting logic:
  `python -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_curvefit_enh_20260305`.
  Run completed and emitted manifest
  `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_curvefit_enh_20260305.json`.
- New K3Z fit diagnostics are available at `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsak3z-*.png` (9 plots for
  strata/SI combos with usable VDYP outputs: CWH_CW, CWH_FD, CWH_HW), with raw VDYP lines
  visible in the updated style.
- Ran full K3Z post-TIPSY integration using user-supplied BatchTIPSY output:
  copied `data/02_output-tsak3z.out` to expected runtime filename
  `data/04_output-tsak3z.out`, then executed
  `python -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --resume --run-id k3z_posttipsy_20260306_062442`.
  Run completed successfully (manifest:
  `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_posttipsy_20260306_062442.json`) and regenerated K3Z artifacts,
  including `plots/strata-tsak3z.png`, `plots/tipsy_vdyp_tsak3z-*.png`,
  `data/tipsy_params_tsak3z.xlsx`, and `data/tipsy_curves_tsak3z.csv`.
- Debugged K3Z strata diagnostics regression and fixed summary/plot logic:
  `src/femic/pipeline/tsa.py::build_strata_summary(...)` now avoids reintroducing filtered strata
  as NaN rows, and falls back to unfiltered top strata when `min_standcount` removes everything
  (small custom boundaries).
- Improved strata plotting robustness in `src/femic/pipeline/plots.py`:
  relative-abundance ordering now tolerates missing `totalarea_p`,
  SI x-limits auto-expand to observed values (so high coastal SI is not clipped at 30),
  and sparse-strata `stripplot` points are overlaid on violins for visibility.
- Added K3Z-specific legacy TIPSY-vs-VDYP y-axis scaling helper
  `tipsy_vdyp_ylim_for_tsa(...)` (`0..1500` for `k3z`, default `0..600`) and wired
  `01b_run-tsa.py` to use it.
- Re-ran K3Z end-to-end with the fixes:
  `python -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_plotfix_20260306_063833`.
  Run completed (`status=ok`, manifest:
  `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_plotfix_20260306_063833.json`) with corrected
  01a diagnostics (`coverage 1.0`, `count 9`) and refreshed K3Z plot artifacts.
- Applied K3Z-focused scoping + comparison updates:
  set `TARGET_NSTRATA_BY_TSA["k3z"] = 4` in `src/femic/pipeline/tsa.py`
  to constrain the custom-boundary case to top-4 strata by area.
- Updated smoothing-output selection in `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py` so K3Z
  exports tail-blend unmanaged curves (when available) to
  `vdyp_curves_smooth-tsak3z.feather` for downstream TIPSY-vs-VDYP comparison plots,
  while keeping fitdiag overlays unchanged (`current` + candidate curves).
- Added regression coverage:
  `tests/test_pipeline_helpers.py` now asserts `target_nstrata_for("k3z") == 4`,
  and `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py` now verifies K3Z smoothing output prefers tail-blend
  candidate curves when present.
- Deleted all stale K3Z plot artifacts (`plots/*tsak3z*`) and re-ran K3Z end-to-end:
  `python -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_n4_tailblend_20260306_064902`.
  Run completed (`status=ok`, manifest:
  `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_n4_tailblend_20260306_064902.json`) with
  01a diagnostics now reporting `count 4` and `coverage 0.9882` (top-4 strata only).
- Implemented adaptive SI split-count logic in `src/femic/pipeline/tsa.py` from per-stratum
  5th-95th percentile SI width:
  `< 5` -> `M` only, `5..10` -> `L/H`, `> 10` -> `L/M/H`.
- Wired the same adaptive SI quantile resolver into VDYP curve fitting
  (`src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py::fit_stratum_curves`) so fit outputs and AU definitions
  stay aligned for narrow-SI strata.
- Hardened SI assignment and AU mapping for variable split counts:
  `assign_si_levels_from_stratum_quantiles(...)` now supports optional
  `allowed_levels_by_stratum`, and `00_data-prep.py` passes allowed levels inferred from
  `au_table` so post-01b stand assignment cannot request non-existent SI bins.
- Updated TIPSY parameter assembly to tolerate missing per-stratum SI bins cleanly
  (`src/femic/pipeline/tipsy.py::build_tipsy_params_for_tsa` skips absent fit levels).
- Added regression coverage for adaptive split behavior and missing-level handling:
  `tests/test_pipeline_helpers.py`, `tests/test_tipsy.py`, `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py`.
- Re-validated K3Z end-to-end under the adaptive SI split logic:
  `FEMIC_NO_CACHE=1 PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_siwidth_verify_20260306_070055`.
  Run completed `status=ok` (manifest:
  `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_siwidth_verify_20260306_070055.json`), producing
  an 8-row K3Z TIPSY input table where `CWH_CW` is now correctly split into `L/H` only.
- Fixed K3Z comparison-plot scaling request:
  `src/femic/pipeline/plots.py::tipsy_vdyp_ylim_for_tsa(...)` now returns `0..2000`
  for `k3z` (was `0..1500`), with regression assertion updated in
  `tests/test_pipeline_helpers.py`.
- Fixed fitdiag regeneration behavior:
  1) `01a_run-tsa.py` now rebuilds smoothing outputs whenever `resume_effective=False`
     (so non-resume/no-cache runs do not silently reuse stale
     `vdyp_curves_smooth-tsa*.feather`), and
  2) `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py` now emits fitdiag PNGs even when binned
     observations are missing (overlay is conditional, plot emission is unconditional).
- Fixed no-cache VDYP bootstrap cache reuse:
  `00_data-prep.py` now sets `force_run_vdyp = 1` whenever `_femic_no_cache` is active,
  preventing stale `data/vdyp_results-tsa*.pkl` reuse during no-cache/debug/custom-boundary runs.
- Fixed adaptive-SI bootstrap dispatch bug surfaced by forced reruns:
  `src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py::execute_bootstrap_vdyp_runs(...)` now skips missing/empty
  SI payloads per stratum (`status=skipped`, reason `missing_or_empty_si_sample`) instead of
  raising `KeyError` when a stratum has `L/H` only under adaptive split rules.
- Re-ran K3Z with forced fresh VDYP bootstraps:
  `FEMIC_NO_CACHE=1 PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_forcevdyp_fix_20260306_072037`.
  Run completed `status=ok` (manifest:
  `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_forcevdyp_fix_20260306_072037.json`) and regenerated
  current K3Z artifacts from fresh caches:
  `data/vdyp_results-tsak3z.pkl` (updated), 8 fitdiag plots (`plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tsak3z-*.png`)
  and 8 TIPSY-vs-VDYP comparison plots (`plots/tipsy_vdyp_tsak3z-*.png`).
- Extracted K3Z FSP stocking guidance from `data/bc/cfa/k3z/NICF-LP-Forest-Stewardship-Plan-Appendices-2020.pdf` (Appendix B, pp. 4-6) and replaced provisional K3Z TIPSY assumptions with FSP-informed mixed-species pathways in `config/tipsy/tsak3z.yaml`.
- Updated K3Z TIPSY rule set to use CWH-leading-species pathways (`CW/YC`, `HW/HM`, `FD/FDC`, `SS/SX`) with `Density=900`, `Regen_Delay=2`, and explicit mixed compositions summing to 100% instead of single-species 1400-sph defaults.
- Re-ran K3Z no-cache pipeline with new rules:
  `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_fsp_rules_20260306_073524`.
  Run completed (`status=ok`, manifest `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_fsp_rules_20260306_073524.json`) and regenerated K3Z artifacts.
- Verified regenerated `data/02_input-tsak3z.dat` now reflects new FSP-informed parameters (8 rows; all rows `Density=900`, `Regen_Delay=2`, and mixed-species compositions such as `CW60/HW25/YC15`, `HW70/CW20/FD10`, `FD60/HW25/CW15`).
- Next: user runs BatchTIPSY with the refreshed K3Z DAT, uploads updated `data/04_output-tsak3z.out`, then we re-run post-TIPSY to evaluate whether TIPSY-vs-VDYP coherence improved under FSP-informed assumptions.
- Added a dedicated K3Z compile/iteration playbook at
  `planning/CFAK3Z_dataset_compile_plan.md`, adapted from TSA29 planning but
  rewritten for K3Z-specific constraints (small-area sparse strata, fixed BatchTIPSY
  field-map dependency, and iterative TIPSY-vs-VDYP tuning workflow).
- Documented next refinement queue for K3Z stratification:
  1) BEC subzone/variant/phase-based keys and
  2) top-N leading-species combination keys (start N=2, test N=3).
- Confirmed VRI attribute availability needed for this refinement from local 2019
  GDB (`BEC_SUBZONE`, `BEC_VARIANT`, `BEC_PHASE`, `SPECIES_CD_1..6`,
  `SPECIES_PCT_1..6`, SI fields).
- Confirmed `data/bc/vri/VEG_COMP_LYR_R1_POLY_2024.gdb.zip` currently fails unzip
  integrity checks (incomplete/corrupt), so K3Z refinement should proceed on
  existing readable VRI until a clean 2024 download is available.

- Added configurable stratum-key controls to the run-profile/env pipeline:
  `selection.stratification.bec_grouping` (`zone|subzone|variant|phase`),
  `selection.stratification.species_combo_count` (top-N species by `SPECIES_PCT_1..6`),
  and `selection.stratification.include_tm_species2_for_single`.
- Wired those controls from YAML -> effective run options -> legacy execution env
  (`FEMIC_STRAT_*`) -> `00_data-prep.py` -> `assign_stratum_codes_with_lexmatch(...)`,
  with backward-compatible defaults so existing TSA runs keep legacy behavior.
- Updated K3Z run profile to exercise finer strata by default:
  `config/run_profile.k3z.yaml` now sets `bec_grouping: subzone` and
  `species_combo_count: 2`.
- Confirmed local VRI schema supports this path (fields present in 2019 GDB):
  `BEC_SUBZONE`, `BEC_VARIANT`, `BEC_PHASE`, `SPECIES_CD_1..6`, `SPECIES_PCT_1..6`.
- Updated legacy external-data path resolution to prefer 2024 VRI when present, with
  automatic fallback to 2019:
  `bc/vri/2024/VEG_COMP_LYR_R1_POLY_2024.gdb` -> `bc/vri/2019/VEG_COMP_LYR_R1_POLY.gdb`.
- Added explicit source-path startup prints in `00_data-prep.py` so each run reports the
  exact VRI and TSA boundary datasets in use.
- Added regression coverage to lock 2024-first behavior:
  `tests/test_pipeline_helpers.py::test_resolve_legacy_external_data_paths_prefers_2024_vri_when_available`.
- Extended external-data resolver to also pick a paired VDYP input GDB (2024-first, then 2019)
  and wired `00_data-prep.py` to use that resolved path, with startup printout:
  `using VDYP input source: ...`.
- Verified 2024 K3Z runs now resolve both:
  `VEG_COMP_LYR_R1_POLY_2024.gdb` and
  `VEG_COMP_VDYP7_INPUT_POLY_AND_LAYER_2024.gdb`.
- Current blocker on 2024 K3Z compile quality:
  01a VDYP bootstrap events are all `empty_output`, resulting in
  `data/vdyp_curves_smooth-tsak3z.feather` with `0` rows and thus an empty
  `data/02_input-tsak3z.dat`. This points to a 2024 schema/field-mapping mismatch in
  VDYP input preparation rather than path resolution.
- Completed 2024 VDYP ID-domain fix for K3Z:
  in `run_vdyp_for_stratum(...)` (`src/femic/pipeline/vdyp_stage.py`), bootstrap dispatch now
  resolves sampled source `FEATURE_ID`s to the VDYP table key space using `MAP_ID` when direct
  `FEATURE_ID` overlap is absent, then maps returned VDYP outputs back to source IDs for cache
  compatibility.
- Added regression coverage for the map-join fallback:
  `tests/test_vdyp_stage.py::test_run_vdyp_for_stratum_maps_source_feature_ids_via_map_id`
  asserts that non-overlapping source IDs are bridged through `MAP_ID` and still return results
  keyed by original source `FEATURE_ID`.
- Re-ran full no-cache K3Z pipeline against 2024 VRI+VDYP inputs:
  `FEMIC_NO_CACHE=1 PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -u -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_vri2024_mapfix_20260307`.
  Run completed `status=ok` with non-empty outputs (`data/vdyp_curves_smooth-tsak3z.feather`
  rows `= 3588`, `data/02_input-tsak3z.dat` lines `= 13`) and VDYP report showing no empty-output
  failures (`status counts: dispatch=12, start=12, ok=12`).
- Consulted the local VRI metadata PDFs in `docs/reference` to avoid schema guessing while
  debugging (`vegcomp_poly_rank1_data_dictionaryv5_2019*.pdf`,
  `vegcomp_toc_data_dictionaryv5_2019.pdf`); practical takeaway for this run path remains:
  `MAP_ID` is the reliable bridge field across 2024 VRI rank1 samples and 2024 VDYP input layers
  when `FEATURE_ID` domains diverge.
- Added profile/env support for cumulative top-strata selection by area coverage:
  new config key `selection.stratification.top_area_coverage` (wired through CLI/profile/env as
  `FEMIC_STRAT_TOP_AREA_COVERAGE`) and 01a runtime (`target_area_coverage`) now drive
  `build_strata_summary(..., target_coverage=...)`.
- K3Z profile now sets `top_area_coverage: 0.95` in `config/run_profile.k3z.yaml`.
- Re-ran K3Z no-cache with 95% top-area cutoff:
  `FEMIC_NO_CACHE=1 PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -u -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_cov95_20260307`.
  Result: `coverage=0.95565930139286`, `count=13` strata in 01a (up from 4).
- BEC hierarchy check on selected strata: all selected strata are still identical at
  zone+subzone (`CWHvm`), and also at zone+subzone+variant (`CWHvm1`) and phase (all null),
  so deeper BEC hierarchy splitting cannot add signal for K3Z with current VRI attributes.
- SI split diagnostics for this 95% run show many sparse bins in the long-tail strata
  (`L/M/H` counts often 0-2 stands), with multiple `skipped` or `empty_output` VDYP events;
  this supports a likely next change to collapse SI splitting for sparse strata in K3Z.
- Implemented user-requested K3Z stratification reset and stabilization path:
  `top_area_coverage` lowered to `0.80`, adaptive SI-width split override removed,
  and SI bins restored to fixed quantile bands (`L=5..35`, `M=35..65`, `H=65..95`).
- Added post-fit adjacent SI-curve merge support in TIPSY AU assembly
  (`src/femic/pipeline/tipsy.py::build_tipsy_params_for_tsa`), with configurable
  relative-gap thresholds over a bounded age window; merged groups now map to a
  shared AU while preserving per-stratum diagnostics (`si-groups [...]`).
- Fixed merged-AU downstream regression failure in bundle assignment:
  `assign_curve_ids_from_au_table(...)` now handles duplicate `au_id` rows
  (introduced by SI merges) by collapsing to first non-null managed/unmanaged
  curve IDs before managed/unmanaged curve selection.
- Hardened stand-export AU lookup for merged AUs:
  `prepare_stands_export_frame(...)` now resolves `theme3` canfi species safely
  when `au_table` has duplicate `au_id` rows.
- Added regression tests for merged-AU duplicate-row behavior:
  `tests/test_bundle.py::test_assign_curve_ids_from_au_table_handles_duplicate_au_rows`
  and `tests/test_stands.py::test_prepare_stands_export_frame_handles_duplicate_au_rows`.
- Re-validated K3Z end-to-end with requested settings:
  `FEMIC_NO_CACHE=1 PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -u -m femic run --run-config config/run_profile.k3z.yaml -v --run-id k3z_cov80_fixedsi_merge_debug2_20260307`
  now completes `status=ok` (manifest:
  `vdyp_io/logs/run_manifest-k3z_cov80_fixedsi_merge_debug2_20260307.json`).
- Next tuning focus (as requested): keep fixed quantile SI bins, then adjust
  post-fit merge criteria to avoid over-fragmentation while preserving clearly
  distinct VDYP curve families.
- Implemented pre-fit SI-bin stabilization in `fit_stratum_curves(...)`:
  added `min_stands_per_si_bin` (default `25`) and automatic adjacent-bin collapse before
  NLLS fitting; collapse actions are now logged per stratum (for sparse K3Z bins this
  prevents fragile one- or two-stand regressions).
- Updated TIPSY SI-level merge logic in `build_tipsy_params_for_tsa(...)` to use a
  combined criterion instead of max-relative-gap alone:
  merge now requires both `max_relative_gap <= threshold` and
  `window_nrmse <= threshold` over a shared age window; merge diagnostics now print
  `gap/rmse/nrmse` values.
- Added deterministic config-driven species/siteprod overrides for weak mapping cases:
  `species_code_overrides` (for example `DR -> FD`) and
  `siteprod_si_fallback_by_species` are now supported by `tipsy_config` builders and
  consumed by candidate evaluation when siteprod SI is absent/invalid.
- Added requested stratum-level L/M/H overlay plot output:
  `execute_curve_smoothing_runs(...)` now emits
  `plots/vdyp_lmh_tsa<tsa>-<stratum>-<code>.png` so L/M/H best-fit curves are visible on
  one panel for ordering/material-difference QA.
- Wired legacy siteprod source resolution to prefer
  `data/bc/siteprod/Site_Prod_BC.gdb` (fallback to legacy root path), and surfaced the
  resolved path in 00-data-prep startup logging.
- Re-ran full no-cache K3Z with fresh 2024 VRI/VDYP + fresh siteprod source:
  `run_id=k3z_siteprod_refresh_20260307` completed `status=ok` with updated fitdiag,
  L/M/H overlay, and TIPSY-vs-VDYP plot outputs under `plots/`.
- Next tuning queue (explicitly requested): continue calibrating post-fit tail/merge
  hyperparameters and SI-bin collapse thresholds now that the new diagnostics are in place.
- Two-pass K3Z rebin regression root cause identified: stale TSA-specific VDYP feather caches
  (`data/vdyp_ply-tsak3z.feather`, `data/vdyp_lyr-tsak3z.feather`) were still being reused even
  under `FEMIC_NO_CACHE=1`, so first-pass VDYP key remap operated on mismatched IDs.
- Fixed loader precedence and cache refresh behavior:
  `load_vdyp_input_tables(...)` now prioritizes explicit `source_feature_ids` over `source_map_ids`,
  and 01a now forces VDYP source reload whenever `runtime_config.force_run_vdyp` is true.
- Fixed VDYP output remap robustness:
  `run_vdyp_for_stratum(...)` now maps per-table outputs back to resolved feature IDs via VDYP
  table attrs (`Map Name` + `Polygon`) before ID/order fallbacks, handling table-number keyed
  outputs and extra-table cases.
- Verified with fresh no-cache K3Z run
  (`run_id=k3z_twopass_fix5_20260307`): two-pass now reports
  `mapped VDYP SI for 194/251 rows` (was `0/251`), `missing=3 of 447` in cache-table rebuild
  (was `447/447`), and full downstream TIPSY/bundle stages complete without empty-curve failure.
- Added configurable SI-bin collapse threshold to run profiles:
  `modes.vdyp_min_stands_per_si_bin` now flows from YAML/CLI profile parsing into
  legacy env (`FEMIC_VDYP_MIN_STANDS_PER_SI_BIN`) and into 01a stratum fitting
  (`build_stratum_fit_run_config(min_stands_per_si_bin=...)`).
- Updated K3Z test profile for current iteration:
  `config/run_profile.k3z.yaml` now uses `top_area_coverage: 0.90` and
  `modes.vdyp_min_stands_per_si_bin: 10` (with `species_combo_count: 2`).
- Executed no-cache K3Z validation run with these settings:
  `tmp/k3z_sc2_restore.log` reports `coverage=0.90655`, `count=9` selected strata,
  and currently generated AU bundle has `27` AUs (`9 strata x 3 SI levels`), with
  Sitka spruce present (`CWHvm_HW+SS`).
- Executed comparison run for 3-species stratification under same thresholds:
  `tmp/k3z_sc3_run.log` reports `coverage=0.90153`, `count=25` selected strata;
  resulting AU bundle expanded to `66` AUs (`22 strata x 3 SI levels` after downstream
  consolidation), confirming species-combo=3 greatly increases fragmentation.
- Next suggested tuning step for teaching-case usability: keep species-combo=2 as
  default, then selectively carve SS-focused strata via explicit rule/override
  rather than globally increasing to species-combo=3.
- Added AU species-proportion curve export in post-TIPSY bundle assembly:
  for each AU, `curve_table/curve_points_table` now include
  `unmanaged_species_prop_<SPP>` and `managed_species_prop_<SPP>` curves (single-point at `x=1`).
- Species universe for these curves is pre-scanned from inventory checkpoint
  `data/ria_vri_vclr1p_checkpoint8.feather` using top-6 VRI slots (`SPECIES_CD_1..6` with
  positive `SPECIES_PCT_*`) scoped to selected TSA(s); this yields a full consistent per-AU
  species set (zero-valued curves emitted for absent species in a specific AU).
- Unmanaged species proportions are sourced from VDYP fit payload species shares per
  `(stratum_code, si_level)`; managed species proportions are sourced from
  `tipsy_sppcomp_tsa<tsa>.csv` proportions.
- Added regression coverage for species-proportion curve emission:
  `tests/test_bundle.py::test_build_bundle_tables_from_curves_adds_species_proportion_curves`.
- 2026-03-08 (TIPSY DAT hardening): finalized fixed-schema DAT rendering in `src/femic/pipeline/tipsy.py` using explicit row/header start maps, mandatory full schema columns (including blank GW/SPP slots), and fixed-length line emission so BatchTIPSY column mappings remain stable for sparse K3Z mixes.
- 2026-03-08 (verification): regenerated `data/02_input-tsak3z.dat` from `data/tipsy_params_tsak3z.xlsx`; row slices now cleanly parse expected values (`PCT_1=70`, `SI=23.9`, `SPP_2=CW`, `PCT_2=20`, `SPP_3=FD`, `PCT_3=10`) without `7023.` concatenation.
- 2026-03-08 (TIPSY DAT alignment fix #2): switched DAT row layout to exact 1-based BatchTIPSY wizard indices from the user screenshots (converted to 0-based in code), including sparse-field ranges like `PCT_1: 61-63`, `Regen_Method: 64`, `SI: 108-111`, `SPP_2: 129-131`, `PCT_2: 136-137`, etc.; line length now fixed at 231 chars to match GW_age_5 end column.
- 2026-03-08 (TIPSY DAT anti-regression hardening): introduced a single canonical `DEFAULT_TIPSY_BATCH_COLUMNS_1BASED` schema (directly mirroring BatchTIPSY wizard indices), derive 0-based starts/widths from it, and enforce per-row fixed-width slice validation before writing DAT output; generator now fails fast on any field overflow/misalignment.
- 2026-03-08: Per request, removed all prior plot files and ran a full fresh no-cache K3Z compile using current profile settings; produced a clean single set of regenerated K3Z plots for review (`run_id=k3z_fresh_20260308_032428`).
- 2026-03-08: Added a profile-driven managed-yield fallback mode for teaching/small-case stability (`modes.managed_curve_mode: vdyp_transform`) that synthesizes managed curves directly from VDYP unmanaged curves via configurable transforms (`x_scale`, `y_scale`, culmination-tail truncation, `max_age`).
- 2026-03-08: Applied this mode to K3Z profile (`x_scale=0.8`, `y_scale=1.2`, truncate tail, max age 300), cleared old plots, and reran a full fresh no-cache K3Z compile (`run_id=k3z_vdyp_managed_20260308_1`) producing a clean regenerated plot set.
- 2026-03-08: Added a new roadmap phase (`Phase 4`) to track `femic.fmg` delivery:
  Patchworks-first ForestModel XML + fragments shapefile generation from current FEMIC outputs,
  with Woodstock portability work carried in parallel but prioritized second.
- 2026-03-08: Added initial `femic.fmg` implementation in `src/femic/fmg/patchworks.py`:
  ForestModel XML writer, fragments shapefile builder, and high-level
  `export_patchworks_package(...)` orchestration wired from bundle/checkpoint artifacts.
- 2026-03-08: Added `femic export patchworks` CLI command in `src/femic/cli/main.py`
  with configurable TSA list, bundle/checkpoint paths, planning horizon, CC age window,
  output directory, and fragments CRS.
- 2026-03-08: Fixed Patchworks fragments export for feather checkpoints with WKB geometry payloads:
  exporter now normalizes bytes/memoryview/hex geometries before GeoDataFrame construction.
- 2026-03-08: Added regression coverage for Patchworks export in
  `tests/test_fmg_patchworks.py` and `tests/test_cli_main.py` (XML content, fragments fields,
  CLI wiring, WKB decode case).
- 2026-03-08: Updated user-facing docs for Patchworks export:
  `README.md` quickstart and `docs/reference/cli.rst` command reference.
- 2026-03-08: Ran full milestone validation gates after export implementation:
  `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest`,
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W` all passing.
- 2026-03-08: Added fail-fast Patchworks validation in `src/femic/fmg/patchworks.py`:
  `validate_forestmodel_xml_tree(...)` now checks required ForestModel nodes/attrs,
  required define fields, curve-idref integrity, and CC treatment presence; and
  `validate_fragments_geodataframe(...)` now checks required fragment schema,
  value domains (`IFM`), geometry validity/non-null, uniqueness of `BLOCK`,
  numeric coercion, and positive area.
- 2026-03-08: Hooked validations into export orchestration:
  `export_patchworks_package(...)` now validates XML tree and fragments data before writing.
- 2026-03-08: Added regression tests for validation rules in
  `tests/test_fmg_patchworks.py` (missing curve-idref detection and invalid IFM rejection).
- 2026-03-08: Validated Patchworks package builds for both active test cases:
  `k3z` via direct CLI export from current bundle/checkpoint, and `tsa29` via
  a reconstructed TSA29 validation bundle/checkpoint built from cached TSA29 prep artifacts
  (`vdyp_prep-tsa29.pkl`, `vdyp_curves_smooth-tsa29.feather`,
  `tipsy_curves_tsa29.csv`, `tipsy_sppcomp_tsa29.csv`).
- 2026-03-08: Documented the Patchworks export contract in docs:
  `docs/reference/patchworks-export.rst` now captures required ForestModel XML
  structure and required fragments schema fields enforced by exporter validators.
- 2026-03-08: Added initial Woodstock compatibility export module
  `src/femic/fmg/woodstock.py` with `export_woodstock_package(...)`
  (CSV outputs from current FEMIC bundle/checkpoint artifacts), wired to
  CLI as `femic export woodstock`.
- 2026-03-08: Added shared FMG core dataclasses in `src/femic/fmg/core.py`
  (`CurvePoint`, `CurveDefinition`, `AnalysisUnitDefinition`, `BundleModelContext`)
  and bundle adapters in `src/femic/fmg/adapters.py` so Patchworks/Woodstock exporters
  consume one normalized AU/curve context instead of duplicating parsing logic.
- 2026-03-08: Refactored `src/femic/fmg/patchworks.py` and
  `src/femic/fmg/woodstock.py` to use shared adapters/context; revalidated exports:
  - Patchworks `k3z` (`au=14`, `fragments=218`, `curves=54`)
  - Woodstock `k3z` (`yield_rows=16162`, `area_rows=218`)
  - Woodstock `tsa29` from reconstructed validation bundle/checkpoint
    (`yield_rows=10050`, `area_rows=147959`).
- 2026-03-08: Added initial deterministic Patchworks XML fixture parity coverage
  (`tests/fixtures/fmg/forestmodel_minimal.xml`,
  `tests/test_fmg_patchworks.py::test_write_forestmodel_xml_matches_fixture`)
  as the first concrete step toward `P4.2b`.
- 2026-03-08: Completed core class migration milestone for `P4.2a` by adding
  explicit ForestModel/Treatment-related dataclasses in `src/femic/fmg/core.py`
  (`ForestModelDefinition`, `SelectDefinition`, `TreatmentDefinition`,
  `AttributeBinding`, `DefineFieldDefinition`, `TreatmentAssignment`) and moving
  Patchworks XML construction to `build_patchworks_forestmodel_definition(...)`
  + `forestmodel_definition_to_xml_tree(...)`.
- 2026-03-08: Expanded deterministic XML parity coverage for `P4.2b` with a
  richer multi-AU/species fixture:
  `tests/fixtures/fmg/forestmodel_multi_au.xml` and
  `tests/test_fmg_patchworks.py::test_write_forestmodel_xml_matches_multi_au_fixture`.
- 2026-03-08 next queue: start treatment transition/action parity work beyond
  baseline CC assignment (legacy semantics), and extend Woodstock compatibility
  outputs toward direct model ingest conventions.
- 2026-03-08: Started treatment transition/action parity by extending the
  Patchworks treatment model/serializer to emit `<transition>` assignments;
  baseline CC tracks now include `IFM -> 'managed'` transition assignment
  (configurable via `--cc-transition-ifm`).
- 2026-03-08: Extended Woodstock compatibility export toward direct-ingest
  conventions by adding `woodstock_actions.csv` and
  `woodstock_transitions.csv` outputs (plus CLI support for `--cc-min-age` /
  `--cc-max-age`).
- 2026-03-08 next queue: add configurable per-AU transition target fields
  (beyond IFM only), and evaluate adding Woodstock `.yld` writer/import parity
  helpers for tighter legacy interoperability.
- 2026-03-08: Implemented species-wise yield curve derivation in Patchworks XML:
  for each AU/IFM species, emit `feature.Yield.*.<SPP>` (and managed product
  equivalents) as `TotalVolume(age) * SpeciesProp(age)` with piecewise-linear
  species-proportion interpolation at total-curve ages.
- 2026-03-08: Added coverage for derived species yields in
  `tests/test_fmg_patchworks.py::test_build_forestmodel_xml_tree_adds_species_yield_curves`
  and regenerated deterministic XML fixtures to lock serializer parity.
- 2026-03-08: Updated Patchworks XML serialization to drop redundant repeated
  y-values on both far-left and far-right tails for non-`unity` curves (keep
  the inner edge points of each terminal plateau), matching Patchworks behavior
  of extending terminal points horizontally.
- 2026-03-08: Hardened Patchworks XML point serialization for schema safety:
  sanitize non-finite point values (replace non-finite `y` with `0.0`, drop
  non-finite `x`), enforce monotonic/deduped `x` ordering, and fix all-flat
  curve trimming to retain earliest age point (avoids degenerate `(299,0)` tails).
- 2026-03-08: Switched Patchworks XML curve IDs from opaque numeric aliases to
  readable deterministic identifiers (`managed_total_*`, `unmanaged_prop_*`,
  `au_*_managed_yield_*`), while preserving unique idref linkage.
- 2026-03-08: Updated Patchworks XML point formatting to emit integer age `x`
  values when age is integral (default case), while preserving float formatting
  only for genuinely non-integral x values.
- 2026-03-08: Updated Patchworks XML `y` formatting by curve family:
  volume-yield curves now round to 1 decimal place; normalized/proportion
  curves round to at most 5 decimals (avoids excessive precision noise).
- 2026-03-08: Added CC harvested-volume product consequences in Patchworks XML:
  each select now includes `product.HarvestedVolume.managed.Total.CC` and
  species-wise `product.HarvestedVolume.managed.<SPP>.CC` attributes bound to
  managed total/species yield curves; validated via refreshed fixtures/tests
  and regenerated `output/patchworks_k3z_validated/forestmodel.xml`.
- 2026-03-08: Audited Patchworks managed/unmanaged semantics against
  `reference/UserGuide.pdf` and corrected FMG export assumptions:
  fragments exporter now writes one stand-fragment row per block (`1 fragment = 1 block`)
  with binary IFM assignment (`managed`/`unmanaged`) using THLB signal precedence
  (`thlb` -> `thlb_fact` -> `thlb_area` -> `thlb_raw`), matching the simplified K3Z
  teaching model requirement.
- 2026-03-08: Removed redundant Patchworks CC transition IFM assignment:
  exporter no longer writes `assign IFM='managed'` within managed-only select
  statements by default; `--cc-transition-ifm` is now optional (unset by default),
  and only non-redundant transitions (e.g., `unmanaged`) are emitted.
- 2026-03-08: Renamed upstream bundle yield terminology from
  `managed/unmanaged` to `treated/untreated` to avoid semantic collision with
  Patchworks IFM keywords. Bundle assembly now emits:
  - `curve_type` values `treated` / `untreated`
  - species-proportion curve types `treated_species_prop_*` /
    `untreated_species_prop_*`
  while preserving back-compat aliases (`managed_curve_id` /
  `unmanaged_curve_id`) and adding canonical AU columns
  (`treated_curve_id` / `untreated_curve_id`).
- 2026-03-08: Split documentation source from development reference assets:
  moved non-Sphinx PDFs out of `docs/reference/` into top-level `reference/`
  (including `reference/vdyp/`), leaving `docs/` as Sphinx source only; updated
  path references in `config/tipsy/tsa29.yaml`, `ROADMAP.md`, and
  `CHANGE_LOG.md`, and added `reference/README.md` to document directory intent.
- 2026-03-09 (seral semantics correction; feature-only accounts):
  - Confirmed Patchworks model semantics issue: `product.Seral.*` attributes are
    conceptually invalid for inventory state and should not be exported.
  - Removed `product.Seral.*` emission from
    `build_patchworks_forestmodel_definition(...)`; seral output now remains
    `feature.Seral.*` only.
  - Updated tests/docs to enforce and document feature-only seral attributes.
  - Live K3Z model repair:
    - removed `product.Seral.*` attributes from
      `C:\Users\gep\Documents\msfm\msfm2025\k3z_patchworks_model\yield\forestmodel.xml`,
    - re-ran `femic patchworks matrix-build` and verified both
      `protoaccounts.csv` and `accounts.csv` now contain `feature.Seral.*` only.
- 2026-03-09 (seral treatment-area consequence accounts + map layer):
  - Added Patchworks exporter support for treatment-consequence seral area
    accounts in CC product tracks with labels:
    `product.Seral.area.<stage>.<au_id>.CC`.
  - Updated docs/tests to reflect this semantic split:
    - inventory/state: `feature.Seral.*`
    - treatment consequences: `product.Seral.area.*.*.CC`.
  - Live K3Z model update:
    - injected `product.Seral.area.*.*.CC` attributes in
      `yield/forestmodel.xml`,
    - re-ran `femic patchworks matrix-build` and verified accounts appear in
      `protoaccounts.csv` and `accounts.csv`.
  - Added Seral Stages map layer to
    `analysis/base.pin` using sample-style `DitherTheme` configuration
    (`feature.Seral.*`, caption `Dithered Seral Stage`, layer title
    `Seral Stages`).
- 2026-03-10 (Patchworks matrix-build account sync + seral wiring):
  - Added post-build `tracks/protoaccounts.csv -> tracks/accounts.csv` sync in
    `femic patchworks matrix-build`, with timestamped backup of existing
    `accounts.csv` before overwrite and manifest/CLI reporting of sync status.
  - Added optional `--seral-stage-config` YAML support to
    `femic export patchworks` to emit per-AU seral curves and
    `feature.Seral.*` / `product.Seral.*` attributes with default or per-AU
    override boundaries.
  - Added `config/seral.k3z.yaml` starter config for K3Z seral stage setup.
- 2026-03-10 (CC treatment min age logic update):
  - Updated Patchworks exporter so CC `minage` resolves to
    `CMAI(managed_total_curve) - 20` per AU (clamped to `0..cc_max_age`).
  - `cc_min_age` remains as a fallback only when managed yield curve metadata is
    unavailable for an AU.
- 2026-03-10 (tracked K3Z prototype model moved in-repo):
  - Moved/copy-synced the active K3Z Patchworks prototype model into the repo at
    `models/k3z_patchworks_model/` so it can be versioned and shared with
    students/collaborators.
  - Updated `config/patchworks.runtime.windows.yaml` matrix builder paths to
    point at `../models/k3z_patchworks_model/...` (config-relative paths).
  - Verified `femic patchworks preflight` and `femic patchworks matrix-build`
    run successfully against the in-repo model (`run_id=repo_model_move_verify_20260310`).
- 2026-03-10 (plot docs follow-up): queued a docs enhancement to include the
  regenerated K3Z strata/AU plots in the student-facing Sample Models guide
  after the next full pipeline rerun refreshes those artifacts.
  - Added pending roadmap item `P8.6d`:
    `Roll regenerated strata/AU build plots into user-facing K3Z docs`.
- 2026-03-10 (validation gate unblock for docs checkpoint): resolved
  cross-platform/runtime regressions so full repository quality gates pass in
  this Windows environment.
  - Normalized selected emitted path strings to POSIX form where tests and
    downstream interchange contracts require stable separators
    (`legacy env boundary path`, `release manifest paths`, VDYP context/command
    payload strings, stand export file target path string).
  - Added graceful no-op behavior for VDYP diagnostic plotting when
    `matplotlib` is unavailable.
  - Hardened species slot derivation to exclude NaN-like species tokens.
  - Re-ran required gates successfully:
    `ruff format src tests`, `ruff check src tests`, `mypy src`, `pytest`,
    `pre-commit run --all-files`, `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`.
- 2026-03-10 (Phase 9 rebrand planning kickoff): added a dedicated rebrand
  phase to move repository/project naming from `wbi_ria_yield` to `femic`,
  covering metadata, URLs, runtime path cleanup, slug sweep policy, and cutover
  validation workflow.
  - Created branch `feature/rebrand-femic` and marked `P9.5a` complete.
- 2026-03-10 (Phase 9 implementation slice 1): completed the first rebrand
  implementation pass across canonical metadata and operator-facing config/docs.
  - Updated project naming/title surfaces to `femic` in:
    `README.md`, `docs/conf.py`, `docs/index.rst`, and `CITATION.cff`.
  - Added explicit transition note in `README.md`:
    formerly `wbi_ria_yield`.
  - Updated target URLs to new slug endpoints:
    `github.com/UBC-FRESH/femic` and `ubc-fresh.github.io/femic`.
  - Removed old hard-coded slug path from `config/patchworks.runtime.yaml`;
    runtime now relies on `SPSHOME` env for install-home resolution.
  - Marked complete: `P9.1`, `P9.2a`, `P9.2b`, `P9.3a`, `P9.5b`.
- 2026-03-10 (Phase 9 implementation slice 2): validated post-rename runtime
  smoke behavior and locked env-driven Patchworks install-home handling with
  regression coverage.
  - Runtime checks:
    - `python -m femic --help` succeeds (CLI smoke).
    - `sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W` succeeds (docs smoke).
    - `femic patchworks preflight --config config/patchworks.runtime.windows.yaml`
      succeeds on this host.
    - `femic patchworks preflight --config config/patchworks.runtime.yaml`
      now fails only on missing local artifacts (jar/fragments/xml), not
      `SPSHOME` lookup when env is provided.
  - Added regression test in `tests/test_patchworks_runtime.py`:
    `test_load_patchworks_runtime_config_uses_env_spshome_when_field_missing`.
  - Marked complete: `P9.3b`, `P9.3c`, `P9.5c`.
  - GitHub Actions observation: latest `docs-pages` deployment currently
    advertises `https://ubc-fresh.github.io/wbi_ria_yield/`; need a post-merge
    main-branch deploy to confirm transition to `.../femic/`.
  - `P9.2c` remains pending until a post-merge docs-pages deployment confirms
    the new published URL target after rename.
- 2026-03-10 (Patchworks install-registration heuristic): updated preflight to
  explicitly warn when `SPSHOME` is missing from the process environment,
  reflecting the operational assumption that a correct Patchworks install should
  set `SPSHOME`.
  - Added warning text in `run_patchworks_preflight(...)`:
    missing `SPSHOME` indicates install/registration may be incomplete.
  - Added regression test:
    `tests/test_patchworks_runtime.py::test_run_patchworks_preflight_warns_when_env_spshome_missing`.
- 2026-03-10 (Pages post-rename verification + Node 24 readiness): confirmed
  docs are live under the renamed repo/docs URL and updated workflow defaults
  to avoid pending Node 20 action deprecation risk.
  - Confirmed GitHub Pages publish target is now `https://ubc-fresh.github.io/femic/`.
  - Updated `.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml` to set:
    `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true`.
  - Upgraded `actions/upload-pages-artifact` from `@v3` to `@v4`.
  - Marked `P9.2c` complete.
- 2026-03-10 (Phase 9 closure pass): completed legacy-slug sweep enforcement
  and notebook-output cleanup policy so rebrand phase can be closed.
  - Added `Notebook Output Cleanup Policy` section to
    `docs/guides/legacy-traceability.rst` with explicit output-clearing guidance
    and `nbconvert --clear-output` command.
  - Added docs contract checks in `tests/test_docs_contract.py` for:
    - required notebook cleanup policy section presence,
    - legacy slug reference restrictions (allowed in audit-trail files only).
  - Removed remaining transition slug mention from `README.md` to keep active
    user-facing docs/config free of historical slug references.
  - Marked complete: `P9.2`, `P9.4a`, `P9.4b`, `P9.4c`, and parent `P9.4`.
- 2026-03-10 (Phase 10 implementation slice 1: instance decoupling + bootstrap):
  implemented instance-rooted CLI path resolution and deployment workspace
  scaffolding as the first concrete Phase 10 delivery.
  - Added `src/femic/instance_context.py` with resolver precedence:
    `--instance-root` -> `FEMIC_INSTANCE_ROOT` -> CWD, plus legacy repo-root
    compatibility fallback warning.
  - Added shared `--instance-root` support across operational commands
    (`run`, `prep validate-case`, `tipsy validate`, `tsa post-tipsy`,
    export commands, and patchworks runtime commands), and rewired relative
    paths to resolve under instance root.
  - Added `femic instance init` (`instance` CLI namespace) with filesystem-first
    scaffold generation (`config/`, `config/tipsy/`, `data/`, `output/`,
    `vdyp_io/logs/`, `.gitignore`, `QUICKSTART.md`).
  - Added optional BC-wide VRI dataset bootstrap with built-in URLs and default
    yes/no prompt:
    `VEG_COMP_LYR_R1_POLY_2024.gdb.zip` and
    `VEG_COMP_VDYP7_INPUT_POLY_AND_LAYER_2024.gdb.zip`.
  - Added package-owned resources under `src/femic/resources/` for instance
    templates and legacy scripts (`00_data-prep.py`, `01a_run-tsa.py`,
    `01b_run-tsa.py`), and updated workflow runtime to execute packaged scripts
    by default (no hard dependency on repo-root script paths).
  - Added/updated tests for instance-context resolution, instance bootstrap,
    packaged legacy resource loading, and CLI wiring.
  - Marked complete: `P10.1a/P10.1b/P10.1c`, `P10.2a/P10.2b/P10.2c`,
    `P10.3a/P10.3b/P10.3c`.
- 2026-03-10 (Phase 10 scope extension: public-but-inaccessible dataset mirror):
  added a new Phase 10 workstream to publish missing FEMIC-required public
  datasets (including archived HectaresBC `misc*.tif` layers) through a
  DataLad-powered GitHub dataset repository with Arbutus special-remote object
  storage, then link that dataset back into FEMIC as a git submodule.
  - Added checklist `P10.6a/P10.6b/P10.6c/P10.6d` for inventory, publishing,
    submodule integration, and collaborator runbook coverage.
- 2026-03-10 (Phase 10 `P10.6a` complete: dataset inventory + provenance baseline):
  published the required dataset inventory for DataLad mirror planning, with
  explicit access mode and checksum status fields.
  - Added machine-readable registry:
    `metadata/required_datasets.yaml`
    covering VRI/VDYP provincial layers, TSA boundaries, Site_Prod_BC,
    HectaresBC `misc.thlb.tif`, support assets, and case-specific boundary
    geometry.
  - Added user-facing guide:
    `docs/guides/data-access-inventory.rst`
    and wired it into docs navigation.
  - Updated deployment-instance guide to reference the authoritative registry.
  - Marked `P10.6a` complete; next queued step is `P10.6b` (publish DataLad
    dataset repository and configure Arbutus special remote).
- 2026-03-10 (Phase 10 `P10.6d` complete: DataLad operator runbook + mirror seed):
  added maintainer/operator docs and seed artifacts so the mirror workflow can
  be executed deterministically once the dataset repo is created.
  - Added guide `docs/guides/public-data-mirror-runbook.rst` with
    create/publish steps plus collaborator clone/get/update commands.
  - Added `metadata/datalad_mirror_seed.csv` as the current
    `datalad_mirror.include=true` extraction from dataset registry.
  - Added maintainer bootstrap note:
    `planning/femic_public_data_datalad_bootstrap.md`.
  - Marked `P10.6d` complete; next queued implementation is
    `P10.6b` followed by `P10.6c`.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 `P10.6c` complete + local `P10.6b` bootstrap):
  created a local DataLad dataset mirror repo and linked it back into FEMIC as
  a Git submodule at `external/femic-public-data`.
  - Created local dataset repo at `/home/gep/projects/femic-public-data` and
    mirrored current seed artifacts from this workspace:
    - `data/misc.thlb.tif`
    - `data/bc/tsa/FADM_TSA.gdb`
    - `data/bc/siteprod/Site_Prod_BC.gdb`
    - `data/bc/vri/2019/VEG_COMP_LYR_R1_POLY.gdb`
    - `data/bc/vri/2019/VEG_COMP_VDYP7_INPUT_POLY_AND_LAYER_2019.gdb`
  - Added submodule linkage in FEMIC:
    `external/femic-public-data`.
  - Marked `P10.6c` complete.
  - `P10.6b` remains open pending GitHub publish + Arbutus special-remote
    configuration + checksum backfill in `metadata/required_datasets.yaml`.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 `P10.6b` execution hardening with lab KB template):
  aligned FEMIC DataLad mirror runbook/bootstrap docs to the known-good
  Arbutus S3 command sequence from the FRESH lab workflow workshop materials.
  - Updated `docs/guides/public-data-mirror-runbook.rst` to use explicit
    `git annex initremote arbutus-s3` setup, followed by
    `datalad create-sibling-github --publish-depends arbutus-s3`.
  - Added credential/export and recovery notes (`git annex enableremote`) to
    reduce clone/get failures caused by ordering/config mismatches.
  - Updated `planning/femic_public_data_datalad_bootstrap.md` with source links
    to the imported KB/workshop references in `tmp/`.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 `P10.6b` creds bootstrap template standardization):
  added a repo-local Arbutus credentials template and ignore policy so
  maintainers can source AWS/S3 env vars consistently without risking secret
  commits.
  - Added template:
    `config/credentials/arbutus_env.template.sh`.
  - Updated `.gitignore` to ignore concrete credential scripts under
    `config/credentials/*.sh` while keeping `*.template.sh` tracked.
  - Updated `docs/guides/public-data-mirror-runbook.rst` and
    `planning/femic_public_data_datalad_bootstrap.md` to use the new template
    path in the `P10.6b` setup sequence.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 `P10.6b` complete: published mirror repo + Arbutus upload):
  completed the publish phase for the FEMIC public-data mirror dataset.
  - Verified published dataset repository:
    `https://github.com/UBC-FRESH/femic-public-data`.
  - Verified `git-annex` object availability on `arbutus-s3` for mirrored
    seed artifacts, including:
    - `data/misc.thlb.tif`
    - `data/bc/vri/2019/VEG_COMP_LYR_R1_POLY.gdb/a00000009.gdbtable`
  - Backfilled checksum values in `metadata/required_datasets.yaml` for all
    current `datalad_mirror.include=true` artifacts and documented the
    deterministic directory-hash method for `*.gdb` datasets.
  - Marked `P10.6b` complete; with `P10.6a/P10.6c/P10.6d` already complete,
    parent `P10.6` is now complete.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 `P10.4a` complete: canonical in-repo reference instance):
  established a maintainer reference deployment instance under
  `instances/reference/`, separate from package source templates.
  - Generated `instances/reference/` via `femic instance init` with
    `--no-download-bc-vri` for deterministic in-repo scaffolding.
  - Added docs section in `docs/guides/deployment-instances.rst` defining
    `instances/reference/` as the canonical maintainer reference location.
  - Added docs contract coverage in `tests/test_docs_contract.py` to require
    the reference instance path and key scaffold files.
  - Marked `P10.4a` complete; next execution step remains `P10.4b`.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 `P10.4b` complete: docs/tests/examples repointed):
  repointed maintainer-facing workflow docs and template-instantiation tests to
  use the canonical in-repo reference instance layout.
  - Updated guides:
    `docs/guides/case-onboarding.rst`,

  wording and removed remaining active references.
  - Updated `README.md` external-data note to describe instance-root-relative
    behavior rather than repo-root assumptions.
  - Updated `docs/sample-models/k3z.rst` wording from "repository root" to
    workspace-root phrasing.
  - Added `tests/test_docs_contract.py` check to fail on forbidden active
    deployment wording (`repository root`, `repo root`, and host-specific
    `/home/gep/projects/` paths) across key docs/config files.
  - Marked `P10.4c` complete; with `P10.4a/P10.4b` already complete, parent
    `P10.4` is now complete.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 `P10.5a` complete: package build/release checks):
  added automated and documented package-distribution checks and fixed runtime
  package metadata so wheel smoke installs are executable.
  - Added GitHub Actions workflow:
    `.github/workflows/package-release-checks.yml` running:
    `python -m build`, `twine check dist/*`, and wheel-install smoke
    (`femic --help`, `femic instance init ...`).
  - Added README maintainer section documenting equivalent local commands.
  - Expanded `pyproject.toml` runtime `dependencies` to include required
    import-time packages (for example `numpy`, `pandas`, `geopandas`, `scipy`,
    `rasterio`) discovered by wheel-smoke failure diagnostics.
  - Added docs contract test coverage requiring workflow presence and required
    packaging-check commands (`tests/test_docs_contract.py`).
  - Marked `P10.5a` complete; next execution step remains `P10.5b`.

  extended publish-readiness verification to cover an installed-wheel case
  preflight run in a clean virtual environment.
  - Updated `.github/workflows/package-release-checks.yml` to run:
    installed `femic prep validate-case` after `femic instance init`.
  - Added CI fixture setup in workflow for minimal preflight prerequisites:
    required instance-local data/runtime placeholders, mock `wine` on `PATH`,
    and a minimal external-data tree via `FEMIC_EXTERNAL_DATA_ROOT`.
  - Extended `tests/test_docs_contract.py` package-workflow contract assertions
    to require installed-package preflight coverage.
  - Marked `P10.5b` complete; next execution step remains `P10.5c`.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 10 `P10.5c` complete: install->instance->run docs finalization):
  finalized user-facing docs for installed-package execution flow.
  - Updated `README.md` quickstart to lead with:
    `python -m pip install femic` -> `femic instance init` -> `femic run ...`
    and switched primary command examples to installed CLI form.
  - Updated deployment/onboarding pipeline guides to use installed CLI commands
    as primary examples:
    `docs/guides/deployment-instances.rst`,
    `docs/guides/case-onboarding.rst`,
    `docs/guides/pipeline-overview.rst`.
  - Added docs contract checks in `tests/test_docs_contract.py` to require
    explicit installed-package workflow text.
  - Marked `P10.5c` complete; with `P10.5a/P10.5b` already complete, parent
    `P10.5` is now complete.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 11 complete: K3Z standalone example instance + submodule):
  implemented and published the canonical full K3Z instance repository and
  linked it back into FEMIC for onboarding and reproducible case setup.
  - Defined contract note:
    `planning/femic_k3z_instance_repo_contract.md`.
  - Published public repo:
    `https://github.com/UBC-FRESH/femic-k3z-instance` with initial baseline
    tag `v0.1.0`.
  - Added submodule linkage:
    `external/femic-k3z-instance`.
  - Updated docs to reference the standalone K3Z repo + submodule workflow and
    added operator commands:
    `git submodule update --init --recursive`,
    `git submodule update --remote external/femic-k3z-instance`.
  - Added docs-contract assertions requiring K3Z repo and submodule references.
  - Marked `P11.1/P11.2/P11.3/P11.4/P11.5` complete.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 planning kickoff): added a concrete execution phase for
  relocated K3Z rebuild validation and standalone K3Z documentation buildout,
  including explicit FHOPS-template alignment requirements for cross-project
  FRESH lab Sphinx consistency.
  - Added `P12.1/P12.2` for relocated Patchworks matrix-build execution,
    bugfix verification, and regression evidence capture.
  - Added `P12.3/P12.4` for standalone `femic-k3z-instance` Sphinx docs
    scaffolding and TSR-style user-guide expansion.
  - Added `P12.5` to formalize a shared FRESH lab Sphinx template baseline
    using FHOPS as canonical reference.
  - Added `P12.6` for documentation ownership, cadence, and release policy.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 `P12.1a/P12.1b` execution on relocated K3Z instance):
  ran Windows native Patchworks preflight + blocks build + matrix build in
  `external/femic-k3z-instance`.
  - Added instance-local runtime config:
    `external/femic-k3z-instance/config/patchworks.runtime.windows.yaml`.
  - Executed successful runs with artifacts/logs under:
    `external/femic-k3z-instance/vdyp_io/logs/`
    (run ids: `k3z_relocated_20260311`, `k3z_relocated_20260311b`).
  - `accounts.csv` sync/backup behavior confirmed via manifest.
  - Noted structural drift from tracked baseline remains and requires follow-up
    under `P12.2` (for example lower account/treatment counts after rebuild).
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 scope extension: cross-platform geospatial bootstrap):
  added explicit `fiona`/`GDAL` hardening tasks for Linux/Windows local `.venv`
  bootstrap reliability.

  default requirement for all new FEMIC deployment-instance projects.
  - Added `P13.1` contract definition tasks for required inputs, sequence, invariants, and failure taxonomy.
  - Added `P13.2` orchestration tasks for first-class CLI rebuild execution + manifest/report outputs.
  - Added `P13.3` per-instance rebuild spec/template tasks, including K3Z backfill as reference.
  - Added `P13.4` regression guardrail tasks (invariants, baseline diffs, allowlisted deltas, fail-fast behavior).
  - Added `P13.5` user-facing documentation/runbook tasks for authoring and interpreting rebuild reports.
  - Added `P13.6` enforcement tasks to make this mandatory in `instance init`, docs contracts, and release gates.
- 2026-03-11 (K3Z runtime validation feedback: species account completeness):
  user confirmed rebuilt K3Z launches in Patchworks without startup errors and
  now shows nonzero volume in species-wise accounts except `PL`.
  - Added follow-up task `P12.2d` to verify `PL` vs `PLC` semantics in this
    case and, if `PL` is not valid for current K3Z inputs, remove/trim `PL`
    from generated accounts/targets/docs to avoid student confusion.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 `P12.1c` + `P12.2a/b/c` execution: reproducible K3Z rebuild checks):
  implemented and exercised a deterministic rebuild-and-validate script for the
  relocated K3Z instance.
  - Fixed and expanded `scripts/k3z/rebuild_k3z_instance.py` to:
    - execute full rebuild flow,
    - emit machine-readable report JSON,
    - record key artifact timestamps,
    - enforce species/seral/block-join invariants,
    - compare structural `tracks/*.csv` invariants against a baseline snapshot.
  - Added baseline snapshot: `scripts/k3z/k3z_tracks_baseline.json`.
  - Executed evidence runs:
    - `k3z_reprocheck_20260311_2` (baseline initialized with `--write-baseline`),
    - `k3z_reprocheck_20260311_3` (baseline regression check pass),
    - `k3z_reprocheck_20260311_4` (clean repeat pass after UTC warning fix).
  - Latest report confirms:
    `managed_area_ha=1781.3132360577583`, `passive_area_ha=0.0`,
    `block_join_csv_only=0`, `block_join_shp_only=0`,
    `seral_account_count=75`, `baseline_match=true`.
  - Marked complete: `P12.1c`, `P12.2a`, `P12.2b`, `P12.2c`.
  - Left open: `P12.2d` (`PL` vs `PLC` semantics cleanup for student-facing clarity).
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 terminology normalization complete): replaced
  legacy curve-source terminology across active FEMIC code/docs with
  `untreated/treated`, while preserving IFM terminology as
  `managed/unmanaged`.
  - Updated bundle/adapters/export logic and tests to use
    `untreated_curve_id`/`treated_curve_id` and
    `untreated_species_prop_*`/`treated_species_prop_*` naming.
  - Updated user-facing docs/metadata wording to remove legacy curve-source
    references and align with `untreated/treated`.
  - Completed `P12.8a/P12.8b/P12.8c`.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 `P12.2d` completion): validated `PL` vs `PLC` behavior
  in K3Z and implemented zero-signal species trimming so `PL` no longer appears
  as an empty managed species account when no treated species-proportion signal
  exists for `PL`.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 `P12.3a` complete: standalone K3Z Sphinx scaffold):
  created and published the baseline standalone docs scaffold in
  `external/femic-k3z-instance`.
  - Submodule commit pushed: `6c61c71` (`femic-k3z-instance/main`).
  - Added docs files: `docs/conf.py`, `docs/index.rst`,
    `docs/getting-started.rst`, `docs/model-anatomy.rst`,
    `docs/rebuild-and-qa.rst`, `docs/troubleshooting.rst`, and
    `docs/requirements.txt`.
  - Added publishing/build config: `.readthedocs.yaml` and
    `.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml`.
  - Added parent docs-contract check in `tests/test_docs_contract.py` requiring
    standalone K3Z docs scaffold presence and key toctree entries.
  - Verified standalone docs build:
    `python -m sphinx -b html docs docs/_build/html -W` in submodule root.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 `P12.3b` complete + FEMIC RTD-theme alignment):
  published and validated standalone K3Z docs, then aligned FEMIC docs publish
  deps to the same Read the Docs theme baseline.
  - Verified `femic-k3z-instance` docs deployment run success and URL:
    `https://ubc-fresh.github.io/femic-k3z-instance/`.
  - Added FEMIC docs dependency file: `docs/requirements.txt`
    (`sphinx`, `sphinx-rtd-theme`).
  - Updated FEMIC docs workflow to install docs deps from
    `docs/requirements.txt` so GitHub Pages builds use RTD theme consistently.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 `P12.3c` complete): added standalone K3Z docs acceptance
  checks for required navigation and section coverage.
  - Expanded docs contract tests in `tests/test_docs_contract.py` to require:
    - guide toctree structure in `external/femic-k3z-instance/docs/index.rst`,
    - required headings and command snippets in `getting-started.rst`,
    - required anatomy/edit-policy sections in `model-anatomy.rst`,
    - required reproducibility sections and script references in
      `rebuild-and-qa.rst`,

- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 roadmap amendment: TSR-grade K3Z data-package depth):
  refined Phase 12 docs scope to explicitly target BC small-unit data-package
  structure/depth expectations using three exemplar references.
  - Added `P12.4d/P12.4e/P12.4f/P12.4g/P12.4h` to enforce:
    exemplar section crosswalk, standalone K3Z data-package page set,
    evidence/provenance tables, student usability acceptance content, and
    publication acceptance criteria.
  - Added `P12.5e` to ensure FHOPS template alignment does not dilute
    BC data-package depth expectations.
  - Exemplar references for structure baseline:
    `reference/TFL26_Information_Package_Sept-2018_v1.1.pdf`,
    `reference/CFA_Analysis_Report.pdf`,
    `reference/FNWL_Analysis_Report.pdf`.
  - Next execution sequence locked:
    `P12.4d -> P12.4e -> P12.4f -> P12.4g -> P12.4h`.
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 `P12.4d/P12.4e/P12.4f/P12.4g` execution):
  added TSR-grade K3Z standalone data-package docs and acceptance checks using
  the TFL26/CFA/FNWL exemplar structure as the baseline.
  - Added standalone docs pages:
    `data-package-crosswalk.rst`, `land-base-and-netdown.rst`,
    `assumptions-registry.rst`, `base-case-analysis.rst`.
  - Wired new pages into standalone docs navigation in
    `external/femic-k3z-instance/docs/index.rst`.
  - Added docs-contract coverage in `tests/test_docs_contract.py` requiring:
    crosswalk sections, exemplar references, TSR-style required headings, and
    provenance-table columns plus operator usability sections.
  - Marked complete: `P12.4d`, `P12.4e`, `P12.4f`, `P12.4g`.
  - Remaining for `P12.4`: `P12.4h` (publish acceptance verification).
- 2026-03-11 (Phase 12 `P12.4h` completion): publication acceptance criteria
  verified for standalone K3Z TSR-style docs update.
  - Verified standalone docs warnings-as-errors build succeeds:
    `python -m sphinx -b html docs docs/_build/html -W` (submodule).
  - Verified parent docs-contract coverage includes required TSR headings and
    provenance/usability sections (`tests/test_docs_contract.py`).
  - Verified GitHub Pages deployment/run and live navigation for new pages:
    run `22981643203` (`success`) and URL
    `https://ubc-fresh.github.io/femic-k3z-instance/`.

    `external/femic-k3z-instance/docs/index.rst`.
  - Extended parent docs-contract checks to enforce required headings for the
    three new pages (`tests/test_docs_contract.py`).
  - Marked complete: `P12.4a`, `P12.4b`, `P12.4c`.
- 2026-03-11 (standalone-docs decoupling hardening): removed parent-repo path
  assumptions from standalone `femic-k3z-instance` docs so the instance docs
  remain valid when consumed outside a FEMIC submodule checkout.
  - Replaced parent-specific script/path references (for example
    `scripts/k3z/rebuild_k3z_instance.py` and `reference/...`) with
    instance-local FEMIC command workflows and generic exemplar citations.

    `autodoc_typehints="description"`, RTD theme options
    (`collapse_navigation=False`, `navigation_depth=3`), and template path.
  - Aligned standalone docs workflow to match current Pages baseline
    (Node24 env flag, `configure-pages`, artifact/deploy action versions,
    pull-request/main gating parity).
  - Added docs-contract enforcement:
    `test_fhops_aligned_sphinx_template_contract`.
  - Confirmed K3Z TSR data-package depth pages remain required via existing
    docs contracts.

    sort), stop-or-continue failure behavior, and machine-readable report
    emission through sink abstraction.
  - Added unit tests:
    `tests/test_rebuild_runner.py` covering deterministic order, failure
